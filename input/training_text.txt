ON (B)(6) 2022, RAYNER INTRAOCULAR LENSES LIMITED RECEIVED NOTIFICATION FROM A UK HEALTHCARE FACILITY OF AN EVENT THAT OCCURRED DURING USE OF A RAYONE ASPHERIC RAO600C. THE EVENT DESCRIPTION PROVIDED STATES THAT THE IMMEDIATELY POST IMPLANTATION THE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL OBSERVED A CRACK IN THE LENS NECESSITATING LENS EXPLANTATION. THE REFERENCE C22013 HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THIS CASE BY RAYNER. THE EVENT DESCRIPTION PROVIDED STATES THAT FOLLOWING IMPLANTATION A CRACK WAS OBSERVED IN THE IOL NECESSITATING EXPLANTATION. TO AID EXPLANTATION, THE LENS WAS CUT INTO TWO PIECES. THE PRODUCT WAS RETAINED AND RETURNED TO RAYNER FOR EVALUATION. THE LENS WAS RETURNED IN TWO PIECES, CONSISTENT WITH THE REPORT OF THE LENS HAVING BEEN CUT IN TWO TO AID LENS EXPLANTATION. COSMETIC INSPECTION OF THE RETURNED LENS UNDER 10X MAGNIFICATION IDENTIFIED A CRACK IN THE CENTRE OF THE LENS; HOWEVER, AS THE LENS HAD BEEN CUT TO FACILITATE LENS EXPLANTATION IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO ESTABLISH IF THIS CRACK IS THE SOURCE OF THE ORIGINAL COMPLAINT OR SUBSEQUENT DAMAGE CAUSED DURING LENS EXPLANT. A PRELIMINARY INSPECTION OF THE RETURNED INJECTOR IDENTIFIED THAT THE PLUNGER WAS FULLY RETRACTED AND THAT THE FLAPS OF THE INJECTOR WERE SLIGHTLY OPEN. THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE FLAPS MAY NOT HAVE BEEN FULLY SECURED AT THE POINT INJECTION WAS STARTED. NO DAMAGE TO THE INJECTOR WAS OBSERVED. THE CONDITION OF THE RETURNED IOL PREVENTED ANY TESTING FROM BEING PERFORMED ON IT. TO FACILITATE TESTING OF THE RETURNED INJECTOR 1X RAO600C +24.0 D FROM RAYNER'S STOCK WAS LOADED AND INJECTED AS PER THE IFU. INJECTION WAS SUCCESSFUL WITH NO DAMAGE TO THE LENS OR INJECTOR POST INJECTION. PRODUCT TESTING HAS BEEN UNABLE TO REPLICATE THE EVENT AS REPORTED. NO DEVICE FAULT FOUND. OUR REVIEW OF PRODUCTION RECORDS FOR THE RAYONE ASPHERIC RAO600C BATCH 081175461 SHOWED THAT ALL MANUFACTURING AND QUALITY CHECKS WERE CONDUCTED WITH SUCCESSFUL RESULTS.

THE PRODUCT AND IMPLANTATION ACCESSORIES SUCH AS CARTRIDGE WAS NOT RETURNED FOR EVALUATION. VIDEO EVALUATION CONFIRMED MARK ON THE OPTIC EDGE. THE ROOT CAUSE MAY BE RELATED TO FAILURE TO FOLLOW IFU (INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE), AS THE CUSTOMER STATES THE USE OF NON-QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC. THE USE OF AN UNQUALIFIED OVD (OPHTHALMIC VISCOSURGICAL DEVICES) MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE LENS AND POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS DURING THE IMPLANTATION PROCESS. LENS DAMAGE MAY OCCUR: DUE TO THE USE OF A NON-QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC. LENS DELIVERY PERFORMANCE MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED WHEN USING OTHER NON-QUALIFIED VISCOELASTICS LEADING TO UNDERFILL, OVERFILL, MISFOLDING , DELIVERY ISSUES AND /OR DAMAGE. IF INADEQUATE VISCOELASTIC IS PLACED IN THE DEVICE THIS WILL CAUSE INADEQUATE COVERAGE OF THE LENS FOLD PATH WHICH MAY CAUSE THE LENS TO ADVANCE INCORRECTLY AND CAUSE DELIVERY ISSUES AND /OR DAMAGE. IF THE OPERATING ROOM TEMPERATURE IS TOO HIGH (> 23°C / 73° F) LENS FOLDING CONSISTENCY IS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED, THE LENS IS MORE ADHERENT AND THIS MAY INHIBIT LENS ADVANCEMENT AND CAUSE DELIVERY ISSUES AND / OR PRODUCT DAMAGE.

ON (B)(6) 2022, RAYNER INTRAOCULAR LENSES LIMITED RECEIVED NOTIFICATION FROM A (B)(6) HEALTHCARE FACILITY OF AN EVENT THAT OCCURRED DURING USE OF A RAYONE EMV RAO200E. THE EVENT DESCRIPTION PROVIDED STATES ".THE FIRST LENS I INSERTED CAME OUT OF THE NOZZLE WITHOUT THE TRAILING HAPTIC DESPITE I MADE SURE THERE WAS DOUBLE CLICK WHEN CLOSING THE CARTRIDGE AND PLENTY OF VISCO IN THERE. SO I HAD TO REMOVE IT AND USE THE SECOND ONE". THE REFERENCE (B)(4) HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THIS CASE BY RAYNER. THE EVENT DESCRIPTION PROVIDED STATES THAT THE HAPTIC BROKE DURING IMPLANTATION NECESSITATING LENS EXPLANTATION. A BACK-UP LENS WAS IMPLANTED SUCCESSFULLY IN THE ORIGINAL SURGERY SESSION. NO PRODUCT RETURN HAS BEEN RECEIVED BY RAYNER IN THIS CASE. DURING TRANSPORT AND PREPARATION FOR SURGERY IT IS POSSIBLE FOR THE LENS TO MOVE IN THE PRELOADED CARTRIDGE ('STORAGE' STATE). THE POSITION OF THE LENS CAN ALSO BE AFFECTED IF THE LENS IS REMOVED FROM THE BLISTER TRAY PRIOR TO VISCOELASTIC BEING INSERTED AND THE FLAPS SECURED (NOTE: REMOVAL OF THE INJECTOR BEFORE THE COMPLETION OF THESE STEPS IS A DEVIATION FROM THE IFU). IT IS THEREFORE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT SUFFICIENT OVD IS INJECTED INTO THE OVD PORT IN LINE WITH OUR INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE ("APPLY SUFFICIENT OVD TO COMPLETELY FILL THE CARTRIDGE" - EQUIVALENT TO APPROXIMATELY 0.3ML). USING THE CORRECT AMOUNT OF OVD ENSURES THAT ENOUGH FORCE IS GENERATED TO MECHANICALLY MOVE THE IOL DOWN INTO THE BOTTOM OF THE CHAMBER READY FOR FOLDING. TOO LITTLE, OR NO OVD CAN LEAD TO MISALIGNMENT OF THE LENS AND IN A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF CASES (ESTIMATED TO BE LESS THAN 2%), A FAILED OR DAMAGED INJECTION. IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT INJECTING OVD INTO ANY OTHER PART OF THE RAYONE INJECTOR (E.G., INCLUDING DIRECTLY INTO THE NOZZLE TIP) IS NOT DESCRIBED IN THE IFU AND COULD CAUSE THE IOL TO BECOME MISALIGNED AND/OR LEAD DIRECTLY TO INJECTION ISSUES. THERE IS INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION/EVIDENCE AVAILABLE TO ESTABLISH THE ROOT CAUSE OF HAPTIC BREAKAGE IN THIS CASE. OUR REVIEW OF PRODUCTION RECORDS FOR THE RAYONE EMV RAO200E BATCH 11118063 SHOWED THAT ALL MANUFACTURING AND QUALITY CHECKS WERE CONDUCTED WITH SUCCESSFUL RESULTS. ALL DEVICES RELEASED FOR DISTRIBUTION FROM THIS BATCH WERE WITHIN TOLERANCE, MET SPECIFICATION CRITERIA AND WERE WITHOUT DEFECTS. A REVIEW OF EXISTING VIGILANCE DATA CONFIRMS THAT THIS IS AN ISOLATED EVENT. NO OTHER INCIDENTS, OF ANY TYPE, HAVE BEEN RECEIVED AGAINST THE RAYONE EMV RAO200E BATCH 11118063.
THE REFERENCE (B)(4) HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THIS CASE BY RAYNER. THE PRELIMINARY INFORMATION RECEIVED STATES THAT THE PATIENT HAS HAD A CORNEAL GRAFT. THIS MAY WELL BE A CONTRIBUTORY FACTOR TO THE UNEXPECTED REFRACTIVE OUTCOME IN THIS CASE; HOWEVER, THERE IS INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION/EVIDENCE AT THIS TIME TO MAKE ANY ASSESSMENT OF ROOT CAUSE. THE RAYNER HYDROPHILIC ACRYLIC INTRAOCULAR LENS USE FMEA IDENTIFIES THE FOLLOWING AS POSSIBLE CAUSES OF "SUB-OPTIMAL AND/OR POOR VISUAL OUTCOME"; INCORRECT PRODUCT SELECTION, ANISEIKONIA COMBINED WITH UNSUITABLE LENS POWER SELECTION, WRONG LENS POWER CAUSED BY INCORRECT BIOMETRY READINGS/CALCULATIONS (E.G. PREVIOUS LASIK PROCEDURE), FUNCTIONAL STYLE OF LENS, DECENTRATION OR TILT, INCORRECT SELECTION OF +DIOPTRE POWER, LENS INSERTED BACK TO FRONT, PATIENT UNABLE TO ADAPT TO FUNCTIONAL STYLE OF LENS, PATIENT WITH SMALL PUPIL DIAMETER, INCORRECT SELECTION OF NEAR/FAR DOMINANT BY SURGEON. RAYNER IFUS CONTRAINDICATE "ACTIVE OCULAR DISEASES (E.G. CHRONIC SEVERE UVEITIS, PROLIFERATIVE DIABETIC RETINOPATHY, CHRONIC GLAUCOMA NOT RESPONSIVE TO MEDICATION"), "CORNEAL DECOMPENSATION" AND "ENDOTHELIAL INSUFFICIENCY". ADDITIONALLY "DEVIATION FROM TARGET REFRACTION" IS LISTED IN THE "ADVERSE EVENTS" SECTION OF THE RAYONE IFU. RAYNER IS FOLLOWING UP WITH THE HEALTHCARE FACILITY TO OBTAIN ALL NECESSARY INFORMATION TO FACILITATE FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THE PATIENT REFRACTIVE OUTCOME. ON (B)(6) 2022, RAYNER INTRAOCULAR LENSES LIMITED RECEIVED NOTIFICATION FROM A (B)(6) HEALTHCARE FACILITY OF AN EVENT THAT OCCURRED FOLLOWING IMPLANTATION OF A RAYONE IOL (MODEL UNSPECIFIED). THE EVENT DESCRIPTION PROVIDED STATES THE POST-OPERATIVELY THE PATIENT'S VISUAL OUTCOME IS NOT IN LINE WITH THE PREDICTED REFRACTIVE OUTCOME.

THE PATIENT DO A LOT OF NIGHTTIME DRIVING AND IT WAS VERY DISTRACTING. THE PATIENTS VISION WAS GOOD, BUT THE HALOS MAKE IT SEEM LIKE IT IS BLURRY. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AS RECEIVED AND STATED THAT, THE DOCTOR HAS PRESCRIBED TWO DIFFERENT EYE DROPS BUT NOTHING HAS HELPED. THE PATIENT HAD TRIED YELLOW LENS AND BLUE LENS GLASSES BUT NOT HELPED. THERE ARE TWO MEDICAL DEVICE REPORTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PATIENT. THIS REPORT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ONE OF THE EYE. A SAMPLE DEVICE WAS NOT RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS. COMPLAINT HISTORY AND PRODUCT HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED AND DOCUMENTATION INDICATED THE PRODUCT MET RELEASE CRITERIA. ROOT CAUSE HAS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED. THERE HAS BEEN ONE OTHER COMPLAINT REPORTED IN THE LOT NUMBER. THE MANUFACTURER INTERNAL REFERENCE NUMBER IS: (B)(4).
AN OPERATING ROOM MANAGER REPORTED THAT DURING IMPLANTATION OF AN INTRAOCULAR LENS (IOL) THE LENS WOULD NOT ADVANCE WITH PATIENT CONTACT. THE PROCEDURE WAS COMPLETED ON THE SAME DAY WITH ANOTHER DEVICE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS RECEIVED STATING THE PATIENT WAS NOT HOSPITALIZED FOR THE EVENT AND THERE WAS NO PATIENT HARM. THE LENS WAS RETURNED FOR EVALUATION. SOLUTION IS DRIED ON THE LENS. THE OPTIC IS PRESSED AGAINST A POST IN THE LENS CASE. EDGE DAMAGE IS OBSERVED WHERE IT IS PRESSED AGAINST THE POST AND A LARGE PIECE OF LENS MATERIAL IS BROKEN. THE LENS WAS CLEANED FOR FURTHER EVALUATION. LIGHT SCRATCHES ARE OBSERVED ON THE OPTIC. A DIMENSIONAL INSPECTION WAS PERFORMED. THE LENS DIMENSIONS ARE ACCEPTABLE (PLAN VIEW) USING AN APPROVED TEMPLATE. PRODUCT HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED AND THE DOCUMENTATION INDICATED THE PRODUCT MET RELEASE CRITERIA. AN UNSPECIFIED CARTRIDGE WITH A COMPANY HANDPIECE AND VISCOELASTIC WAS INDICATED TO BE USED. WITHOUT THE CARTRIDGE MODEL WE CAN NOT VERIFY IF THIS WAS A QUALIFIED COMBINATION. THE PRODUCT INVESTIGATION COULD NOT IDENTIFY A ROOT CAUSE FOR THE REPORTED COMPLAINT OF THE LENS STUCK IN THE CARTRIDGE. THE LENS WAS NOT RETURNED IN THE CARTRIDGE. THE LENS WAS RETURNED IN THE LENS CASE. NO DAMAGE IS OBSERVED TO THE HAPTICS. A DIMENSIONAL INSPECTION WAS PERFORMED. THE LENS DIMENSIONS ARE ACCEPTABLE (PLAN VIEW) USING AN APPROVED TEMPLATE. THE CARTRIDGE WAS NOT RETURNED FOR EVALUATION. THE MANUFACTURER INTERNAL REFERENCE NUMBER IS: (B)(4).
A SURGERY COORDINATOR REPORTED THAT FOLLOWING AN INTRAOCULAR LENS (IOL) IMPLANT PROCEDURE, THE PATIENT HAD MULTIPLE HALOS, HEADACHES. THE IOL WAS EXCHANGED FOR ANOTHER LENS APPROXIMATELY 8 MONTHS FOLLOWING THE INITIAL IMPLANT PROCEDURE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS REQUESTED. A SAMPLE DEVICE WAS NOT RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS. COMPLAINT HISTORY AND PRODUCT HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED AND DOCUMENTATION INDICATED THE PRODUCT MET RELEASE CRITERIA. ROOT CAUSE HAS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED. THERE HAS BEEN TWO OTHER COMPLAINTS REPORTED IN THE LOT NUMBER. (B)(4).
A SCRUB TECHNICIAN REPORTED THAT DURING IMPLANTATION OF AN INTRAOCULAR LENS (IOL) THE HAPTIC WAS BROKEN. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS REQUESTED AND RECEIVED STATING THAT THE LENS WAS LENS WAS DEFECTIVE DURING INSERTION AND NOTICED THAT DURING A POST- OPERATIVE VISIT. THE LENS WAS REMOVED IN A SECONDARY PROCEDURE AND WHILE REMOVING THE LENS THE HAPTIC WAS CHOPPED OFF. ONLY ONE HALF OF THE DAMAGED LENS WAS RETURNED SUBMERGED IN CLEAR LIQUID INSIDE A SMALL PLASTIC SPECIMEN JAR. THE JAR WAS RETURNED IN A LARGE BIOHAZARD BAG. THE LENS WAS REMOVED AND ALLOWED TO AIR DRY PRIOR TO EVALUATION. THE PORTION OF LENS THAT WAS RETURNED CONTAINED THE ONE HAPTIC AREA. THIS HAPTIC WAS BROKEN IN THE DISTAL AREA. THE BROKEN PORTION OF HAPTIC WAS NOT RETURNED. THE OPTIC WAS CUT FROM THE EDGE, THROUGH THE CENTER, TO THE OPPOSITE EDGE SIMILAR IN APPEARANCE TO DAMAGE CREATED WHEN REMOVING A LENS FROM THE EYE. THE OPTIC WAS ALSO TORN AND SPLIT FROM ANOTHER AREA OF THE OPTIC EDGE. THE DAMAGE TRAVELLED HORIZONTALLY TOWARD THE OPTIC CENTER. THE OPTIC ALSO HAD SMALL CRACKED AREAS. PRODUCT HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED AND DOCUMENTATION INDICATES THE PRODUCT MET RELEASE CRITERIA. INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED THAT INDICATED THE USE OF A QUALIFIED CARTRIDGE, HANDPIECE, AND VISCOELASTIC. HALF OF THE EXPLANTED LENS WAS RETURNED TO EVALUATE. THIS HALF INCLUDED ONLY ONE HAPTIC AREA. OPTIC AND HAPTIC DAMAGE WAS OBSERVED. THE DAMAGE THROUGH THE OPTIC FROM EDGE TO EDGE WAS SIMILAR TO DAMAGE DURING REMOVAL FROM THE EYE. ALL LENSES ARE 100% INSPECTED FOR COSMETIC ATTRIBUTES AND THE DAMAGE EXHIBITED BY THE RETURNED COMPLAINT SAMPLE WOULD NOT HAVE MET COMPANY'S RELEASE CRITERIA. BASED ON OUR OBSERVATION, AND THE REVIEW OF MANUFACTURING RECORDS, IT CAN BE REASONABLY CONCLUDED THAT THE ADDITIONAL OPTIC AND HAPTIC DAMAGE IS ALSO NOT MANUFACTURING RELATED. DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF SURGICAL SOLUTION AND THE CONDITION OF THE RETURNED SAMPLE, THE DAMAGE IS MOST LIKELY RELATED TO CUSTOMER HANDLING. INFORMATION PROVIDED IN FOLLOW UP INDICATED THAT THE SURGEON STATES THE LENS WAS DEFECTIVE DURING INSERTION, AND NOTICED ON VISIT, HAD TO BRING PATIENT BACK TO SURGERY TO REMOVE THE LENS. DURING REMOVAL OF THE LENS, THE HAPTIC HAD BEEN CHOPPED OFF. DAMAGE TO THE OTHER HAPTIC AND OTHER HALF OF THE OPTIC CANNOT BE CONFIRMED DUE TO ONLY ONE HALF OF THE EXPLANTED LENS WAS RETURNED. (B)(4).
A NURSE REPORTED THAT DURING AN INTRAOCULAR LENS (IOL) IMPLANT SURGERY, THE LENS ACTUALLY RAN OUT OF CO2 AND THE PLUNGER OF INJECTOR COULD NOT ADVANCE ANY FURTHER. THIS CAUSED HALF THE LENS TO BE IN THE EYE AND THE OTHER HALF TO STICK IN THE CARTRIDGE AND NOT DEPLOY. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN REQUESTED; HOWEVER, FURTHER INFORMATION HAS NOT BEEN RECEIVED. A SAMPLE DEVICE WAS NOT RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS. COMPLAINT HISTORY AND PRODUCT HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED AND DOCUMENTATION INDICATED THE PRODUCT MET RELEASE CRITERIA. ROOT CAUSE HAS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED. THERE HAVE BEEN NO OTHER COMPLAINTS REPORTED IN THE LOT NUMBER. THE MANUFACTURER INTERNAL REFERENCE NUMBER IS: (B)(4).
A NON-HEALTH PROFESSIONAL REPORTED THAT DURING AN INTRAOCULAR LENS (IOL) IMPLANT SURGERY, CARTRIDGES HAVE NOT ALLOWED THE LENS TO GLIDE THROUGH PER THE TECHS.

THESE CARTRIDGES ARE RELATED TO PR1925073 AND 1925091. EVALUATION WILL BE PLACED IN BOTH FILES. THE SEVEN COMPANY CARTRIDGES WERE MICROSCOPICALLY EXAMINED. THE EXTERIOR AND INTERIOR LUMEN WERE EXAMINED WITH NO DAMAGE OR ABNORMALITIES OBSERVED. THE SEVEN COMPANY CARTRIDGES WERE FUNCTIONALLY TESTED PER THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU). NO LENS OR CARTRIDGE DAMAGE WAS OBSERVED AFTER THE LENS DELIVERIES. NO ABNORMAL RESISTANCE WAS OBSERVED. THE SEVEN COMPANY CARTRIDGES WERE CLEANED FOR FURTHER EVALUATION. TOPCOAT DYE STAIN TESTING WAS CONDUCTED WITH ACCEPTABLE RESULTS. PRODUCT HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED AND DOCUMENTATION INDICATED THE PRODUCT MET RELEASE CRITERIA. A QUALIFIED COMPANY LENS WAS INDICATED. THREE OTHER LENS MODELS WERE INDICATED; HOWEVER, THE DIOPTERS BEING USED WERE NOT PROVIDED. IT IS UNKNOWN IF QUALIFIED LENS MODEL/DIOPTERS WERE USED IN ALL INSTANCES. A QUALIFIED HANDPIECE AND VISCOELASTIC WERE INDICATED. THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE REPORTED COMPLAINT COULD NOT BE DETERMINED. THE USED COMPANY CARTRIDGES COMPLAINT SAMPLES WERE NOT RETURNED. NO DETERMINATION CAN BE MADE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EVALUATION OF THE COMPLAINT SAMPLE. SEVEN OF THE RETURNED UNOPENED COMPANY CARTRIDGES FOR THE REPORTED LOT WERE MICROSCOPICALLY EVALUATED. NO DAMAGE OR ABNORMALITIES WERE OBSERVED. FUNCTIONAL AND DYE STAIN TESTING WAS CONDUCTED WITH THE UNOPENED SAMPLES WITH ACCEPTABLE RESULTS. PER THE IFU: USE THE COMPANY CARTRIDGES AT OPERATING ROOM TEMPERATURES BETWEEN 18° C (64° F) AND 23° C (73° F). COMPLETELY FILL THE CARTRIDGE WITH OVD, IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO LOADING AND DELIVERY OF THE LENS. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO LOAD THE LENS WITHOUT ADEQUATE OVD IN THE DEVICE. IT IS UNKNOWN IF QUALIFIED LENS MODEL/DIOPTERS WERE USED IN ALL INSTANCES. ONLY ONE DIOPTER WAS PROVIDED. EACH MODEL HAS A SPECIFIC QUALIFIED DIOPTER RANGE. THE COMPANY DELIVERY SYSTEM IS FOR IMPLANTATION OF QUALIFIED COMPANY FOLDABLE INTRAOCULAR LENS (IOLS). NO UNQUALIFIED LENSES SHOULD BE USED WITH THE COMPANY IOL DELIVERY SYSTEM. THE COMPANY CARTRIDGES ARE QUALIFIED FOR USE WITH COMPATIBLE COMPANY HANDPIECES FOR THE SURGICAL IMPLANTATION OF COMPANY QUALIFIED FOLDABLE IOLS. COMPANY FOLDABLE IOLS ARE QUALIFIED FOR USE WITH AN COMPANY QUALIFIED DELIVERY SYSTEM (HANDPIECE AND CARTRIDGE) AND OPHTHALMIC VISCOSURGICAL DEVICE (OVD) COMBINATION. THE USE OF AN UNQUALIFIED COMBINATION MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE IOL AND POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS DURING THE IMPLANTATION PROCESS. THERE IS ONE OTHER COMPLAINT IS THIS LOT, RELATED FILE, SAME FACILITY. THE MANUFACTURER INTERNAL REFERENCE NUMBER IS: (B)(4).
A PHYSICIAN REPORTED THAT DURING THE INTRAOCULAR LENS (IOL) IMPLANTATION, THE LENS HAPTIC DID NOT FOLD AS PREDICTED IN THE CAPSULAR BAG AND WAS EXPLANTED FROM THE CAPSULAR BAG. THE SURGERY WAS COMPLETED BY USING THE A DIFFERENT LENS WITH THE SAME POWER. THERE WAS NO PATIENT HARM. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN RECEIVED STATING HAPTIC WAS STUCK TO OPTIC FOR A LONG TIME. WITH HELP OF FORCEPS, IT WAS FORCED TO UNFOLD SO THE PHYSICIAN WAS AFRAID IT MIGHT HAVE DENTED THE OPTIC. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN REQUESTED. THE PRODUCT WAS RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS, REPORTED COMPLAINT COULD NOT BE OBSERVED. COMPLAINT HISTORY AND PRODUCT HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED AND DOCUMENTATION INDICATED THE PRODUCT MET RELEASE CRITERIA. THERE HAVE BEEN NO OTHER COMPLAINTS REPORTED IN THE LOT NUMBER. ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS WERE AS FOLLOWS: DEVICE: THE DEVICE WAS RETURNED LOOSE INSIDE THE CARTON. THE LENS STOP AND THE PLUNGER STOP HAVE BEEN REMOVED. THE PLUNGER IS ORIENTED CORRECTLY. VISCOELASTIC IS OBSERVED IN THE DEVICE. THE PLUNGER HAS BEEN RETRACTED INTO THE MID NOZZLE. NO DAMAGE OBSERVED TO THE DEVICE. LENS: THE LENS IS RETURNED OUTSIDE OF THE DEVICE IN A PLASTIC SPECIMEN CONTAINER. SOLUTION IS DRIED ON BOTH SURFACES OF THE OPTIC AND HAPTICS. NO DAMAGE OBSERVED. ROOT CAUSE: THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE REPORTED COMPLAINT COULD NOT BE DETERMINED. NO DAMAGE OBSERVED TO THE LENS OR THE DEVICE. HAPTIC MAY BECOME STUCK TO THE OPTIC: IF INADEQUATE VISCOELASTIC IS PLACED IN THE DEVICE THIS WILL CAUSE INADEQUATE COVERAGE OF THE LENS FOLD PATH WHICH MAY CAUSE THE LENS TO ADVANCE INCORRECTLY AND CAUSE DELIVERY ISSUES AND /OR DAMAGE. IF THE OPERATING ROOM TEMPERATURE IS TOO HIGH (> 23°C / 73° F) LENS FOLDING CONSISTENCY IS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED, THE LENS IS MORE ADHERENT AND THIS MAY INHIBIT LENS ADVANCEMENT OR CONTRIBUTE TO INCORRECT HAPTIC FOLDING. IF THERE IS EXCESSIVE DELAY BETWEEN THE LENS POSITION AT THE PAUSE LOCATION AND THE DELIVERY. THE LENS MAY BECOME MORE ADHERENT WHEN LEFT IN A FOLDED POSITION FOR LONG. ANY OF THE ABOVE LISTED CAUSES ALONE, OR IN COMBINATION, MAY CREATE THE REPORTED EVENT. ALL PRODUCT AND BATCH HISTORY RECORDS ARE QUALITY REVIEWED PRIOR TO PRODUCT RELEASE. THE MANUFACTURER INTERNAL REFERENCE NUMBER IS: (B)(4).

A PHYSICIAN REPORTED THAT, DURING INTRAOCULAR LENS (IOL) IMPLANT PROCEDURE, THE OPTIC WAS FOUND CRACKED AFTER INSERTION OF IOL. THE SURGERY WAS PERFORMED AND COMPLETED AFTER REPLACING THE PRODUCT WITH ANOTHER LENS. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS REQUESTED. THE PRODUCT WAS NOT RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS. VIDEO WAS PROVIDED. VIDEO PROVIDED SHOWS IOL IMPLANTATION. TYPE OF ACCESSORIES USED WITH IOL IMPLANTATION SUCH AS CARTRIDGE AND HANDPIECE CANNOT BE CONFIRMED FROM THE VIDEO. THE PREPARATION OF THE PRODUCT IS NOT RECORDED. THE LENS POSITION AT THE PAUSE LOCATION CANNOT BE CONFIRMED, BUT FROM AVAILABLE FOOTAGE IT APPEARS TO BE ACCEPTABLE. VISCOELASTIC (OVD) LINE IS VISIBLE IN THE CARTRIDGE TIP, NO EXACT DETERMINATION ON THE OVD FILL CAN BE MADE, HOWEVER IT APPEARS THAT THE CARTRIDGE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN FULLY FILLED WITH OVD AS PER INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU) INSTRUCTION. THE LENS IS IMPLANTED, TRAILING HAPTIC IS OBSERVE TO BE ATTACHED TO THE OPTIC FOR A FEW SECOND, IT RELEASES WITH NO ISSUES. THERE APPEARS TO BE MARKS/LINES OVER THE OPTIC EDGE NEAR THE TRAILING HAPTIC ( AT AROUND 7 O'CLOCK POSITION). THE LENS IS CUT IN HALF AND REMOVED. THE COMPLAINANT INDICATES NON COMPANY VISCOELASTIC, WHICH IS NOT QUALIFIED FOR USE WITH THE ASSOCIATED IOL MODEL. THE PRODUCT INVESTIGATION COULD NOT IDENTIFY THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE REPORTED COMPLAINT "CRACK WAS FOUND IN IOL OPTIC". THE PRODUCT AND IMPLANTATION ACCESSORIES SUCH AS CARTRIDGE WAS NOT RETURNED FOR EVALUATION. VIDEO EVALUATION CONFIRMED MARK ON THE OPTIC EDGE. THE ROOT CAUSE MAY BE RELATED TO FAILURE TO FOLLOW IFU, AS THE CUSTOMER STATES THE USE OF NON-QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC. THE USE OF AN UNQUALIFIED OVD MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE LENS AND POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS DURING THE IMPLANTATION PROCESS. THE IFU INSTRUCTS: FILL THE DEVICE UNTIL OVD CAN BE OBSERVED FLOWING TO THE NOZZLE TIP. THIS WILL REQUIRE APPROXIMATELY 0.28 ML OF VISCOELASTIC. IF INADEQUATE VISCOELASTIC IS PLACED IN THE DEVICE THIS WILL CAUSE INADEQUATE COVERAGE OF THE LENS FOLD PATH WHICH MAY CAUSE THE LENS TO ADVANCE INCORRECTLY AND CAUSE DAMAGE. LENS DAMAGE MAY OCCUR: DUE TO THE USE OF A NON-QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC. LENS DELIVERY PERFORMANCE MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED WHEN USING OTHER NON-QUALIFIED VISCOELASTICS LEADING TO UNDERFILL, OVERFILL, MISFOLDING, DELIVERY ISSUES AND /OR DAMAGE. IF INADEQUATE VISCOELASTIC IS PLACED IN THE DEVICE THIS WILL CAUSE INADEQUATE COVERAGE OF THE LENS FOLD PATH WHICH MAY CAUSE THE LENS TO ADVANCE INCORRECTLY AND CAUSE DELIVERY ISSUES AND /OR DAMAGE. IF THE OPERATING ROOM TEMPERATURE IS TOO HIGH (> 23°C / 73° F) LENS FOLDING CONSISTENCY IS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED, THE LENS IS MORE ADHERENT AND THIS MAY INHIBIT LENS ADVANCEMENT AND CAUSE DELIVERY ISSUES AND / OR PRODUCT DAMAGE. ANY OF THE ABOVE LISTED CAUSES ALONE, OR IN COMBINATION, MAY CREATE THE REPORTED EVENT. IN ADDITION TO THIS, ALL IOLS ARE 100% COSMETICALLY INSPECTED AS PER APPROVED MANUFACTURING PROCEDURES AND THE OBSERVED LENS DAMAGE WOULD NOT MEET OUR CURRENT RELEASE CRITERIA. BASED ON THESE INVESTIGATION FINDINGS, WE ARE UNABLE TO VERIFY IF THE IOL/DEVICE CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT. ALL PRODUCT AND BATCH HISTORY RECORDS ARE QUALITY REVIEWED PRIOR TO PRODUCT RELEASE. THERE HAVE BEEN NO OTHER COMPLAINTS FOR THIS LOT. THE MANUFACTURER INTERNAL REFERENCE NUMBER IS: (B)(4).

A NON-HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL REPORTED VIA REPLY CARD DURING AN INTRAOCULAR LENS (IOL) IMPLANT PROCEDURE, LENS WAS FAILED, SITTING IN BOTTOM OF EYE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS REQUESTED.
A DOCTOR OF OPHTHALMOLOGY REPORTED THAT FOLLOWING AN INTRAOCULAR LENS (IOL) IMPLANT PROCEDURE, THE PATIENT'S CORRECTED VISION WAS POOR. HENCE LENS EXCHANGED PROCEDURE WAS PERFORMED WITH A THIRD-PARTY LENS. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN REQUESTED. THE PRODUCT WAS RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS. INVESTIGATION INCLUDING ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS IS IN PROGRESS. A SUPPLEMENTAL MDR WILL BE FILED AS NECESSARY IN ACCORDANCE WITH 21 CFR 803.56 WHEN ADDITIONAL REPORTABLE INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. RESULTS FROM THE PRODUCT HISTORY RECORD REVIEW INDICATED THE PRODUCT MET RELEASE CRITERIA. THERE HAVE BEEN NO OTHER COMPLAINTS REPORTED IN THE LOT NUMBER. THE MANUFACTURER INTERNAL REFERENCE NUMBER IS: (B)(4).
THE PRODUCT WAS NOT RETURNED FOR EVALUATION. VIDEO WAS PROVIDED. VIDEO SHOWS IOL IMPLANTATION WITH COMPANY DEVICE. THE DEVICE PREPARATION IS NOT RECORDED. COMPANY DEVICE NOZZLE COMES IN THE PICTURE. DUE TO THE QUALITY OF THE VIDEO, LENS POSITION IN THE DEVICE AT THE PAUSE LOCATION CANNOT BE CONFIRMED. AS THE LENS IS BEGINNING TO UNFOLDING AFTER IMPLANTATION, A MARK IS VISIBLE NEAR THE EDGE OF THE IOL AT AROUND 4 O'CLOCK POSITION. THE PRODUCT INVESTIGATION COULD NOT IDENTIFY THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE REPORTED COMPLAINT "TRIANGULAR DENT". NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION PROVIDED ON OVD USE AND LENS PREPARATION. NO PRODUCT WAS RETURNED FOR EVALUATION. THERE HAVE BEEN NO OTHER COMPLAINTS FOR THIS LOT DUE TO THE USE OF A NON-QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC. LENS DELIVERY PERFORMANCE MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED WHEN USING OTHER NON-QUALIFIED VISCOELASTICS LEADING TO UNDERFILL, OVERFILL, MISFOLDING , DELIVERY ISSUES AND /OR DAMAGE. IF INADEQUATE VISCOELASTIC IS PLACED IN THE DEVICE THIS WILL CAUSE INADEQUATE COVERAGE OF THE LENS FOLD PATH WHICH MAY CAUSE THE LENS TO ADVANCE INCORRECTLY AND CAUSE DELIVERY ISSUES AND /OR DAMAGE. IF THE OPERATING ROOM TEMPERATURE IS TOO HIGH (> 23°C / 73° F) LENS FOLDING CONSISTENCY IS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED, THE LENS IS MORE ADHERENT AND THIS MAY INHIBIT LENS ADVANCEMENT AND CAUSE DELIVERY ISSUES AND / OR PRODUCT DAMAGE. ANY OF THE ABOVE LISTED CAUSES ALONE, OR IN COMBINATION, MAY CREATE THE REPORTED EVENT. IN ADDITION TO THIS, ALL IOLS ARE 100% COSMETICALLY INSPECTED AS PER APPROVED MANUFACTURING PROCEDURES AND THE OBSERVED LENS DAMAGE WOULD NOT MEET OUR CURRENT RELEASE CRITERIA. BASED ON THESE INVESTIGATION FINDINGS, WE ARE UNABLE TO VERIFY IF THE IOL/DEVICE CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT. BASED ON THE RESULTS FROM THE PRODUCT HISTORY RECORD, THE PRODUCTS MET RELEASE CRITERIA. THE MANUFACTURER INTERNAL REFERENCE NUMBER IS: (B)(4). A PHYSICIAN REPORTED THAT DURING AN INTRAOCULAR LENS (IOL) IMPLANT PROCEDURE, THE HAPTIC HAD SOMETHING TRIANGULAR LIKE A DENT OR SCRATCH SOMEWHERE NEAR THE EDGE. THE ISSUE HAS NO PARTICULAR EFFECT ON THE CONDITION OF THE EYE REQUIRING NO FURTHER MEASURE. THE IOL WAS IMPLANTED IN THE EYE AND STILL REMAINS THERE. THE SURGERY WAS COMPLETED. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS REQUESTED AND PROVIDED THAT IOL OPTIC HAD SOMETHING TRIANGULAR LIKE A DENT NOT A HAPTIC ISSUE.
THE PRODUCT WAS NOT RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS. VIDEO WAS PROVIDED. VIDEO PROVIDED SHOWS IOL IMPLANTATION. TYPE OF ACCESSORIES USED WITH IOL IMPLANTATION SUCH AS CARTRIDGE AND HANDPIECE CANNOT BE CONFIRMED FROM THE VIDEO. THE PREPARATION OF THE PRODUCT IS NOT RECORDED. THE LENS POSITION AT THE PAUSE LOCATION CANNOT BE CONFIRMED, BUT FROM AVAILABLE FOOTAGE IT APPEARS TO BE ACCEPTABLE. VISCOELASTIC (OVD) LINE IS VISIBLE IN THE CARTRIDGE TIP, NO EXACT DETERMINATION ON THE OVD FILL CAN BE MADE, HOWEVER IT APPEARS THAT THE CARTRIDGE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN FULLY FILLED WITH OVD AS PER INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU) INSTRUCTION. THE LENS IS IMPLANTED, TRAILING HAPTIC IS OBSERVE TO BE ATTACHED TO THE OPTIC FOR A FEW SECOND, IT RELEASES WITH NO ISSUES. THERE APPEARS TO BE MARKS/ LINES OVER THE OPTIC EDGE NEAR THE TRAILING HAPTIC ( AT AROUND 7 O'CLOCK POSITION). THE LENS IS CUT IN HALF AND REMOVED. THE COMPLAINANT INDICATES NON COMPANY VISCOELASTIC, WHICH IS NOT QUALIFIED FOR USE WITH THE ASSOCIATED IOL MODEL. THE PRODUCT INVESTIGATION COULD NOT IDENTIFY THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE REPORTED COMPLAINT "CRACK WAS FOUND IN IOL OPTIC". THE PRODUCT AND IMPLANTATION ACCESSORIES SUCH AS CARTRIDGE WAS NOT RETURNED FOR EVALUATION. VIDEO EVALUATION CONFIRMED MARK ON THE OPTIC EDGE. THE ROOT CAUSE MAY BE RELATED TO FAILURE TO FOLLOW IFU, AS THE CUSTOMER STATES THE USE OF NON-QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC. THE USE OF AN UNQUALIFIED OVD MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE LENS AND POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS DURING THE IMPLANTATION PROCESS. THE IFU INSTRUCTS: FILL THE DEVICE UNTIL OVD CAN BE OBSERVED FLOWING TO THE NOZZLE TIP. THIS WILL REQUIRE APPROXIMATELY 0.28 ML OF VISCOELASTIC. IF INADEQUATE VISCOELASTIC IS PLACED IN THE DEVICE THIS WILL CAUSE INADEQUATE COVERAGE OF THE LENS FOLD PATH WHICH MAY CAUSE THE LENS TO ADVANCE INCORRECTLY AND CAUSE DAMAGE. LENS DAMAGE MAY OCCUR: DUE TO THE USE OF A NON-QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC. LENS DELIVERY PERFORMANCE MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED WHEN USING OTHER NON-QUALIFIED VISCOELASTICS LEADING TO UNDERFILL, OVERFILL, MISFOLDING, DELIVERY ISSUES AND /OR DAMAGE. IF INADEQUATE VISCOELASTIC IS PLACED IN THE DEVICE THIS WILL CAUSE INADEQUATE COVERAGE OF THE LENS FOLD PATH WHICH MAY CAUSE THE LENS TO ADVANCE INCORRECTLY AND CAUSE DELIVERY ISSUES AND / OR DAMAGE. IF THE OPERATING ROOM TEMPERATURE IS TOO HIGH (> 23°C / 73° F) LENS FOLDING CONSISTENCY IS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED, THE LENS IS MORE ADHERENT AND THIS MAY INHIBIT LENS ADVANCEMENT AND CAUSE DELIVERY ISSUES AND / OR PRODUCT DAMAGE. ANY OF THE ABOVE LISTED CAUSES ALONE, OR IN COMBINATION, MAY CREATE THE REPORTED EVENT. IN ADDITION TO THIS, ALL IOLS ARE 100% COSMETICALLY INSPECTED AS PER APPROVED MANUFACTURING PROCEDURES AND THE OBSERVED LENS DAMAGE WOULD NOT MEET OUR CURRENT RELEASE CRITERIA.

THE REMAINING PHOTO IS POST-DILATION AND IS OF GOOD RESOLUTION AND MODERATE MAGNIFICATION. IT IS A DIRECT LIGHT VERTICAL SLIT BEAM FOCUSED ON THE ANTERIOR SURFACE OF THE IOL. THE PHOTO IS SIGNIFICANT FOR DIFFUSE PARTICLES THAT APPEAR TO BE LOCATED UPON THE SURFACE OF THE IOL AND COATING THE MAJORITY OF THE SURFACE. WHILE THE ETIOLOGY CANNOT BE STATED WITH CERTAINTY, THE APPEARANCE AND CLINICAL PRESENTATION IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH GLISTENINGS OR LECOG. THE APPEARANCE IS CONSISTENT WITH INFLAMMATORY DEPOSITS. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO MENTION OF INFLAMMATION SEEN IN THE ANTERIOR CHAMBER NOR ANY PATIENT SYMPTOMS SUGGESTIVE OF INFLAMMATION. PRODUCT HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED AND DOCUMENTATION INDICATED THE PRODUCT MET RELEASE CRITERIA. THE PRODUCT INVESTIGATION COULD NOT IDENTIFY A ROOT CAUSE FOR THE REPORTED ISSUES. THE LENS REMAINS IMPLANTED. CLINICAL REVIEW OF THE PROVIDED PHOTOS INDICATED THAT THE APPEARANCE WAS NOT CONSISTENT WITH GLISTENINGS OR LECOG. WHILE THE ETIOLOGY CANNOT BE STATED WITH CERTAINTY BASED ON THE PHOTOS, THE APPEARANCE WAS CONSISTENT WITH INFLAMMATORY DEPOSITS. THE FILE WILL BE REOPENED IF NEW INFORMATION IS PROVIDED. THERE ARE NO OTHER COMPLAINTS IN THIS LOT. THE MANUFACTURER INTERNAL REFERENCE NUMBER IS: (B)(4).
A MATERIALS MANAGEMENT REPORTED THAT DURING AN INTRAOCULAR LENS (IOL) IMPLANT PROCEDURE, LENS WAS SCRATCHED. THE IOL WAS REPLACED DURING THE INITIAL PROCEDURE.

THE PRODUCT WAS NOT RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS. ONLY PHOTO WAS RETURNED. THE RETURNED PHOTO SHOWS AN ACTIVATED COMPANY DEVICE. THE PLUNGER APPEARS TO BE FULLY ADVANCED OUTSIDE OF THE NOZZLE TIP AND APPEARS TO BE ADVANCED OVER THE LENS. THE LENS IS ADVANCED INTO THE MID NOZZLE. WE ARE UNABLE TO DETERMINE THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE REPORTED COMPLAINT "IOL GOT HOOKED IN THE INJECTOR, THE INJECTOR PLUNGER PASSED OVER THE IOL". THE PRODUCT WAS NOT RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS. ONLY PHOTO WAS RETURNED. PLUNGER OVERRIDE WAS OBSERVED ON THE RETURNED PHOTO. PLUNGER OVERRIDE MAY OCCUR: IF THE LENS HAS BECOME MISALIGNED IN THE LENS BAY DURING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. DUE TO THE USE OF A NON-QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC. MATERIAL PROPERTIES OF NON-QUALIFIED OVDS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO UNDERFILL, OVERFILL, MISFOLDING OF THE HAPTICS, OR OTHER INCONSISTENT FOLDING OUTCOMES. IF INADEQUATE VISCOELASTIC IS PLACED IN THE DEVICE THIS WILL CAUSE INADEQUATE COVERAGE OF THE LENS FOLD PATH WHICH MAY CAUSE THE LENS TO ADVANCE INCORRECTLY OR BECOME ¿STUCK¿ IN THE DEVICE ALLOWING THE PLUNGER TO OVERRIDE THE LENS. IF THE OPERATING ROOM TEMPERATURE IS TOO HIGH (> 23°C / 73° F) LENS FOLDING CONSISTENCY IS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED, THE LENS IS MORE ADHERENT AND THIS MAY INHIBIT LENS ADVANCEMENT. ANY OF THE ABOVE LISTED CAUSES ALONE, OR IN COMBINATION, MAY CREATE THE REPORTED EVENT. BASED ON THE RESULTS FROM THE PRODUCT HISTORY RECORD, THE PRODUCTS MET RELEASE CRITERIA. THERE ARE ONE OTHER COMPLAINT IN THE LOT. THE MANUFACTURER INTERNAL REFERENCE NUMBER IS: (B)(4).

THIS CASE HAS BEEN ASSESSED AS REPORTABLE TO THE FDA, AS THE EVENT IATROGENIC STAR-SHAPED RETINAL TEAR/SCLERAL LACERATION (PT: INJECTION SITE LACERATION), WAS DEEMED TO MEET THE SERIOUS CRITERIA OF REQUIRED SURGICAL INTERVENTION TO PREVENT PERMANENT DAMAGE. THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORD COULD NOT BE REVIEWED, AS THE LOT NUMBER WAS NOT REPORTED. SASONGKO, M.B., WAN, R., HO, I. (2022). LARGE, STAR-SHAPED RETINAL TEAR ASSOCIATED WITH ORBITAL COSMETIC FILLER. AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY CASE REPORTS. HTTPS://DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.AJOC.2022.101342. THIS LITERATURE REPORT FROM AUSTRALIA CONCERNS A (B)(6) FEMALE PATIENT. SHE WAS INJECTED WITH HYALURONIC ACID, INTO THE ORBITAL AREA (OFF LABEL USE OF DEVICE, INTENTIONAL DEVICE MISUSE). THE PATIENT HAD ORBITAL FILLER INJECTION WITH INJECTION NEEDLE THAT WENT INTO THE PERIBULBAR SPACE FROM TEMPORAL SITE ADJACENT, AND SLIGHTLY INFERIOR TO LATERAL CANTHUS. AS REPORTED, THE COSMETIC FILLER PROCEDURE WAS PERFORMED BY AN AESTHETIC NURSE WITH INADEQUATE TRAINING RELEVANT TO ORBITAL AND EYE ANATOMY. THE PATIENT WAS HEALTHY. AFTER THE HYALURONIC ACID INJECTION, THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED SYMPTOMS OF DECREASING VISION. TWO DAYS AFTER THE HYALURONIC ACID INJECTION, SHE PRESENTED TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT WITH SUDDEN ONSET OF BLURRED VISION ON HER LEFT EYE. SHE DENIED ANY FLOATERS, FLASHES, OR SHADOWING ON HER VISION. ON THE EXAMINATION, RIGHT VISUAL ACUITY WAS 6/24 IMPROVING WITH PINHOLE TO 6/9 WHEREAS LEFT VISUAL ACUITY WAS 4/60, IMPROVING WITH PINHOLE TO 6/60. INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE WAS 14 AND 11 MMHG FOR THE RIGHT AND LEFT EYE RESPECTIVELY. THE ANTERIOR SEGMENT OF BOTH EYES AND FUNDUS EXAMINATION OF THE RIGHT EYE WERE NORMAL. FUNDUS EXAMINATION OF THE LEFT EYE SHOWED A MILD-MODERATE, UNUSUAL APPEARANCE VITREOUS HAZE AND A LARGE, STAR-SHAPED RETINAL TEAR TEMPORAL TO MACULA. IT WAS FURTHER DESCRIBED AS A LARGE, IATROGENIC STAR-SHAPED RETINAL TEAR. OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY EXAMINATION DEMONSTRATED A NORMAL FOVEAL CONTOUR WITHOUT ANY STRUCTURAL DAMAGE ON THE RETINAL LAYERS. THE AUTHORS PERFORMED 25 GAUGE, PARS PLANA VITRECTOMY WITHIN 48 HOURS AND FOUND A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF JELLY-LIKE MATERIAL IN THE VITREOUS AND AT SUB-RETINA ADJACENT TO THE RETINAL TEAR. THERE WAS ALSO AN EVIDENCE OF A SMALL, ROUND, NEEDLE-SIZE FULL-THICKNESS SCLERAL LACERATION IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TEAR. A ROUTINE VITRECTOMY AND 360-DEGREE PERIPHERAL VITREOUS TRIM WAS DONE UNDER WIDE VIEWING LENS, WHEREAS REMOVAL OF SUB-RETINAL JELLYLIKE MATERIAL WAS PERFORMED MORE METICULOUSLY USING SOFT-TIP CANNULA UNDER HIGH MAGNIFICATION VIEWING LENS. THE AUTHORS TREATED THE TEAR WITH A LASER DURING FLUID AIR EXCHANGE AND FILLED THE EYE WITH 1300 SILICON OIL TAMPONADE AT THE END OF THE SURGERY. THE AUTHORS LEFT THE SILICON OIL FOR 5 WEEKS AND REMOVED THE SILICON OIL AT WEEK 6 FROM THE INITIAL SURGERY. AT ONE WEEK FOLLOWING THE SILICON OIL REMOVAL, LEFT VISUAL ACUITY WAS 6/12, FURTHER IMPROVING WITH PINHOLE TO 6/7.5. THE INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE WAS 12 MMHG AND THE RETINAL TEAR REMAINED ATTACHED. DUE TO THE PROVIDED INFORMATION, THE OUTCOME OF THE EVENTS WAS CONSIDERED AS RESOLVING. IN THE OPINION OF THE AUTHORS, THE UNUSUAL APPEARANCE OF VITREOUS HAZE AND THE RETINAL TEAR DIRECTED THEIR SUSPICION TO A SCLERAL PUNCTURE OCCURRING AT THE TIME OF THE PROCEDURE FROM THE INJECTION NEEDLE. SUBSEQUENT INJECTION OF THE FILLER MATERIALS LED TO FILLER ACCUMULATION IN THE SUB-RETINAL SPACE AND BURST THE RETINA CAUSING A LARGE RETINAL TEAR. THE INFORMATION WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE LOCATION OF PUNCTURE SITE AND RETINAL TEAR, WHICH WAS TEMPORAL TO PERIMACULAR AREA. AT THE INITIAL PRESENTATION, IT SEEMED THAT THE TEAR WAS GOING TO BE LASERED EASILY BECAUSE ALL RETINA WAS FLAT, AND THE LOCATION OF THE TEAR WAS EASILY ACCESSIBLE WITH LASER. HOWEVER, THE LARGE SIZE, IRREGULAR SHAPE OF THE TEAR WHICH WAS MARKEDLY CLOSE TO THE MACULAR AREA WAS POSSIBLY GOING TO CAUSE A SIGNIFICANT RISK OF RETINAL DETACHMENT INVOLVING THE MACULA. MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHILST RETAINED INTRAOCULAR HYALURONIC ACID WAS NATURALLY DEGRADABLE, THE AUTHORS MAIN CONCERN WAS WHETHER SUB-RETINAL FILLER MATERIAL WAS GOING TO AFFECT THE RETINAL ATTACHMENT IF LEFT UNREMOVED. THEREFORE, THE AUTHORS DID NOT TAKE RISK TO JUST PERFORM LASER TREATMENT ALONE AND THE DECISION TO SURGICALLY REMOVE THE FILLER MATERIALS WAS MADE. DURING THE SURGERY, THE AUTHORS FOUND EVIDENCE OF NEEDLE-SIZED FULL-THICKNESS SCLERAL LACERATION AND ALSO THAT THE VITREOUS AND SUB-RETINAL SPACE WAS FILLED WITH JELLY-LIKE MATERIAL. VITRECTOMY, COMPLETE REMOVAL OF FILLER MATERIAL AND LASER TREATMENT AROUND THE TEAR WAS THE CORRECT DECISION TO REDUCE THE RISK OF RETINAL DETACHMENT AND RETINAL TOXICITY FROM THE RETAINED HYALURONIC ACID AND MAINTAIN OPTIMAL VISUAL ACUITY. THE REASON THE AUTHORS USED SILICON OIL TAMPONADE INSTEAD OF GAS WAS BECAUSE THEY FOUND SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FILLER IN THE SUB-RETINAL SPACE. THE AUTHORS ASPIRATED AND EVACUATED AS MUCH FILLER MATERIALS AS POSSIBLE BUT REMAINED UNSURE HOW MUCH AMOUNT OF FILLER MATERIAL WAS LEFT IN THE SUB-RETINAL SPACE. AGAIN, THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT HELPED JUSTIFYING WHETHER SUBRETINAL RESIDUAL FILLER MATERIAL WAS GOING TO AFFECT THE ATTACHMENT OF THE RETINA. FOR THIS REASON, THE PREFERENCE WAS TO PUT SILICON OIL OVER GAS TAMPONADE BECAUSE SILICON OIL MAY PROVIDE LONGER AND MORE STABLE TAMPONADE THAN GAS.

THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED AND THERE WERE NO NON-CONFORMITIES OR DEVIATIONS NOTED DURING THE MANUFACTURING OF THE LENSES THAT WOULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE NATURE OF THIS COMPLAINT. ADDITIONALLY, LENSES ARE 100 % INSPECTED BEFORE THEY LEAVE OUR MANUFACTURING SITE. THEREFORE, WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THE LENS WAS PROCESSED PER STANDARD OPERATION PROCEDURES AND INSPECTIONS AND MET ALL OF THE CRITERIA FOR RELEASE. SACRATCH ISSUES ARE KNOWN TO BE CAUSED BY NUMEROUS FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO: LOADING STRATEGY. LENS PLACEMENT TECHNIQUE. POOR HANDLING DURING FOLDING AND INSERTING. THE IFU INSTRUCTS SURGEONS TO CAREFULLY ASSESS THE PATIENT'S CONDITION INTRAOPERATIVELY TO DETERMINE IF ANY OF THERE ARE ANY COMPLICATIONS PRESENT THAT MAYBE CONTRAINDICATED . THIS ASSESSMENT SHOULD BE USED TO DEFINE A RISK/BENEFIT RATIO FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING IF IMPLANTATION OF A ZEISS IOL IS APPROPRIATE. THIS SAFETY INFORMATION IS PROVIDED TO THE USER AS A NOTIFICATION OF RESIDUAL RISK. THE DEPOSITS ARE LIKELY GMS FROM THE CARTRIDGE. GMS (GLYCEROL MONOSTEARATE) - WHICH IS AN ORGANIC MOLECULE USED AS A LUBRICANT IN THE LUCIA PRODUCT. GMS IS INCORPORATED INTO THE TUBE DURING PRODUCT MANUFACTURING AND IS USED TO EASE THE DELIVERY OF THE LENS; HOWEVER, IT IS NON-TOXIC AND KNOWN TO DISSIPATE OVER TIME. GMS HAS BEEN USED AS A LUBRICANT IN IOL INSERTION INSTRUMENTS FOR MORE THAN 25 YEARS. THEREFORE, WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THIS SUBSTANCE WOULD NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO ANY ADVERSE PATIENT EFFECT. WE HAVE REVIEWED THE INFORMATION PROVIDED AND AT THIS TIME THERE IS NO INDICATION OF A PRODUCT QUALITY ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO THE MANUFACTURING, DESIGN, OR LABELING OF THE DEVICE. IT APPEARS THAT THE REPORTED ISSUE IS LINKED TO USER ERROR. HOWEVER, THE NEED TO EXPLANT THE LENS IS CONSIDERED NEED FOR MEDICAL INTERVENTION IN ORDER TO PREVENT AND AVOID PERMANENT IMPAIRMENT OR DAMAGE TO A BODY STRUCTURE.

DAMAGED HAPTIC AFTER IMPLANTATION. THE DOCTOR EXPLANTED THE IOL FROM THE EYE SINCE HE FOUND THE TRAILING HAPTIC WAS SEPARATED JUST AFTER IMPLANTATION. IT WAS NOTED THAT BSS WAS USED. PATIENT IMPACT: INTRA-OPERATIVE EXPLANTATION. THIS INITIAL AND FINAL EMDR IS BEING SUBMITTED TO FDA FOR A REPORTABLE EVENT THAT OCCURRED OUTSIDE THE USA. HAPTIC DAMAGE IS INDICATED AS A POTENTIAL MALFUNCTION RELATED TO THE IOL, AS COVERED UNDER THE WARNINGS SECTION OF THE PRODUCT'S INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU). IFU NOT FOLLOWED - IT WAS NOTED THAT BSS WAS USED. THE PRECAUTIONS SECTION OF THE PRODUCT'S INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU) STATES: THE LENS HAS BEEN VALIDATED WITH SODIUM HYALURONATE OPHTHALMIC VISCOSURGICAL DEVICES (OVDS); THE USE OF OTHER OVDS AND LUBRICANTS MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE LENS AND POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS DURING IMPLANTATION. PORTIONS OF THE PRODUCT WAS RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER. THE INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED, WITH THE METHODS AND RESULTS AS NOTED BELOW. INCOMPLETE DEVICE RETURNED. THE IOL WAS RETURNED. ONE HAPTIC WAS SEPARATED AT THE ROOT. APPEARANCE CHECK RESULT WAS CONSISTENT TO REPORTED INFORMATION. NO ABNORMALITIES WERE FOUND IN PRODUCTION AND INSPECTION RECORDS OF THE PRODUCT. (SERIAL NO.: (B)(4); MODEL: 255). BASED ON THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION AND OUR INVESTIGATION, WE BELIEVE THIS EVENT WAS NOT CAUSED BY OUR PRODUCT QUALITY. A REVIEW OF THE MOST RECENT COMPLAINT TRENDING DATA INDICATES THAT NO SIGNIFICANT TRENDS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AT THIS TIME AND NO CAPA IS REQUIRED AS PART OF THE PRODUCT EVALUATION.
IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PRELOADED INTRAOCULAR LENS (IOL) WAS EXPLANTED FROM PATIENT'S LEFT EYE DUE TO REFRACTIVE ERROR. ANOTHER J&J LENS OF SAME MODEL AND OF LOWER DIOPTER (22.5D) WAS USED AS THE REPLACEMENT. THERE WAS NO PATIENT INJURY AND NO OTHER INTERVENTION WAS REQUIRED. THE PATIENT WAS DOING FINE POST OPERATION. NO OTHER INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED. PATIENT WEIGHT: UNKNOWN/ASKED BUT UNAVAILABLE. ETHNICITY: UNKNOWN/ASKED BUT UNAVAILABLE. DATE OF EVENT: UNKNOWN, NOT PROVIDED, BUT THE BEST ESTIMATE DATE IS BETWEEN NOV 30, 2021 AND FEB 15, 2022. THE DEVICE WAS NOT RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS.

UPON COMPLETION OF THE REVIEW, IF THERE IS ANY FURTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION A SUPPLEMENTAL MEDWATCH WILL BE FILED. ALL PERTINENT INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO JOHNSON & JOHNSON SURGICAL VISION, INC. HAS BEEN SUBMITTED.
ALTHOUGH REQUESTED, A LOT NUMBER WAS NOT PROVIDED; THEREFORE, A DEVICE HISTORY RECORD REVIEW WAS NOT PERFORMED. BECAUSE THE LENS WAS NOT RETURNED IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE OPACIFICATION OBSERVED BY THE PHYSICIAN IS DUE TO CALCIFICATION OR SOME OTHER MECHANISM; HOWEVER, THREE MAJOR TYPES OF CALCIFICATION HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED: THE PRIMARY FORM REFERS TO CALCIFICATION IS CAUSED BY FACTORS INHERENT TO THE IOL DESIGN OR MATERIAL. THE SECONDARY FORM REFERS TO DEPOSITION OF CALCIUM ONTO THE SURFACE OF THE IOL CAUSED BY ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS (E.G. CHANGES IN THE AQUEOUS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANTED IOL ASSOCIATED WITH PRE-EXISTING OR CONCURRENT DISEASES, OR DUE TO ADDITIONAL SURGICAL INTERVENTION). BY DEFINITION, IT IS NOT RELATED TO ANY PROBLEM WITH THE IOL ITSELF. THE THIRD FORM IS A FALSE-POSITIVE OR PSEUDO-CALCIFICATION IN WHICH OTHER PATHOLOGY IS MISTAKEN FOR CALCIFICATION OR FALSE-POSITIVE STAINING FOR CALCIUM OCCURS. BASED ON THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THE ROOT CAUSE OF THIS EVENT COULD NOT BE CONCLUSIVELY DETERMINED. REPORTEDLY, THE INTRAOCULAR LENS (IOL) WAS EXPLANTED DUE TO PRESUMED CALCIFICATION. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN REQUESTED OF THE REPORTER, BUT NOT YET RECEIVED.
DURING THE PROCESSING OF THIS COMPLAINT, ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO OBTAIN COMPLETE EVENT, PATIENT, AND DEVICE INFORMATION. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE SURGEON WAS UNABLE TO PLACE THE LENS IN THE EYE DUE TO THE HAPTIC KINKING. THE LENS WAS THEN CUT/REMOVED AND AN AC LENS WAS PLACED. NO ADVERSE PATIENT EFFECTS OR CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT DELAY IN PROCEDURE REPORTED. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION PROVIDED. THE DEVICE WAS DISCARDED THUS, A PROPER DEVICE ANALYSIS COULD NOT BE COMPLETED NOR THE REPROTED ISSUE CONFIRMED. THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED AND THERE WERE NO NON-CONFORMITIES OR DEVIATIONS NOTED DURING THE MANUFACTURING OF THE LENSES THAT WOULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE NATURE OF THIS COMPLAINT. ADDITIONALLY, LENSES ARE 100 % INSPECTED BEFORE THEY LEAVE OUR MANUFACTURING SITE. THEREFORE, WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THE LENS WAS PROCESSED PER STANDARD OPERATION PROCEDURES AND INSPECTIONS AND MET ALL OF THE CRITERIA FOR RELEASE. ADDITIONALLY, THERE WAS NO DAMAGE NOTED TO THE LENS DURING PREPARATION FOR USE WHICH SUGGEST A PRODUCT DEFICIENCY DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE REPORTED ISSUE. DAMAGED HAPTICS ARE KNOWN TO BE CAUSED BY NUMEROUS FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO: LOADING STRATEGY, LENS PLACEMENT TECHNIQUE, POOR HANDLING DURING FOLDING AND INSERTING, PATIENT PATHOLOGY. IT APPEARS THAT THE REPORTED ISSUE IS LINKED TO USER ERROR. HOWEVER, THE NEED TO EXPLANT THE LENS IS CONSIDERED NEED FOR MEDICAL INTERVENTION IN ORDER TO PREVENT AND AVOID PERMANENT IMPAIRMENT OR DAMAGE TO A BODY STRUCTURE. IT WAS REPORTED THAT AFTER THE IMPLANTATION OF A CT LUCIA 602 IT WAS NOTED THAT THE HAPTIC WAS KINKED. THUS, THE LENS WAS REMOVED, AND A SPARE LENS WAS USED TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE THE PROCEDURE. NO ADVERSE PATIENT EFFECTS OR CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT DELAY IN PROCEDURE REPORTED.

ON (B)(6) 2022, RAYNER INTRAOCULAR LENSES LIMITED RECEIVED NOTIFICATION FROM ITS RUSSIAN REPRESENTATIVE OF AN EVENT THAT OCCURRED DURING USE OF A RAYONE TORIC RAO610T. THE EVENT DESCRIPTION PROVIDED STATES THAT THE LENS CAME OUT INCORRECTLY WENT THROUGH INTO THE VITREOUS BODY AND TORE THE CAPSULE. THE REFERENCE (B)(4) HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THIS CASE BY RAYNER. THE EVENT DESCRIPTION PROVIDED STATES THAT THE LENS CAME OUT INCORRECTLY WENT THROUGH INTO THE VITREOUS BODY AND TORE THE CAPSULE. THE INFORMATION RECEIVED STATES THAT "DOCTOR HAD TO CATCH IT AND HEM IT. THE OPERATION ENDED SUCCESSFULLY. THERE ARE NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE QUALITY OF VISION". NO PRODUCT WAS AVAILABLE FOR RETURN TO RAYNER. THE RAYNER RISK ANALYSIS IDENTIFIES THE FOLLOWING AS POSSIBLE CAUSES OF "EXPLOSIVE EXPULSION OF LENS"; PLUNGER ADVANCED TOO QUICKLY AND FORCING JAMMED PLUNGER DURING IOL INSERTION. OUR REVIEW OF PRODUCTION RECORDS FOR THE RAYONE TORIC RAO610T BATCH 119145470 SHOWED THAT ALL MANUFACTURING AND QUALITY CHECKS WERE CONDUCTED WITH SUCCESSFUL RESULTS. ALL DEVICES RELEASED FOR DISTRIBUTION FROM THIS BATCH WERE WITHIN TOLERANCE, MET SPECIFICATION CRITERIA AND WERE WITHOUT DEFECTS. A REVIEW OF EXISTING VIGILANCE DATA CONFIRMS THAT THIS IS AN ISOLATED EVENT. NO OTHER INCIDENTS, OF ANY TYPE, HAVE BEEN RECEIVED AGAINST THE RAYONE TORIC RAO610T BATCH 119145470.
A PHYSICIAN REPORTED THAT, AFTER INTRAOCULAR LENS IMPLANT PROCEDURE, A SCRATCH WAS FOUND ON THE IOL OPTIC THAT WAS VISUALLY CONFIRMED. THE SURGERY WAS COMPLETED WITHOUT PRODUCT REPLACEMENT. THERE WAS NO HARM TO THE PATIENT. THE PRODUCT WAS NOT RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS; THE LENS REMAINS IMPLANTED. VIDEO WAS PROVIDED AND THE REPORTED COMPLAINT WAS OBSERVED. VIDEO SHOWS IOL IMPLANTATION. THE IOL APPEARS TO BE IN A CORRECT POSITION AT THE PAUSE LOCATION FOR THE IMPLANTATION. AFTER IMPLANTATION, MARKS/ LINES ARE VISIBLE OVER THE OPTIC. THE MARKS ARE ON THE POSTERIOR SURFACE OF THE LENS. THE LARGER MARK IS BEING MANIPULATED WITH AN ADDITIONAL INSTRUMENTATION, THE MARK CAN BE SEEN PULLED AWAY FROM THE IOL SURFACE. THE REMOVAL OF THE MARK CANNOT BE COMPLETED. FROM THE VIDEO IT APPEARS THAT THIS IS A POTENTIALLY A LARGE SCRATCH, AND IN THE RESULT SOME OF THE LENS MATERIAL HAS COME OFF AND REMAINS PARTIALLY ADHERED TO THE SURFACE. THE PRODUCT INVESTIGATION COULD NOT IDENTIFY THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE REPORTED COMPLAINT "SCRATCH ON OPTIC" . NO PRODUCT WAS RETURNED FOR EVALUATION. VIDEO SHOWED MARKS OVER THE OPTIC AREA. LENS DAMAGE MAY OCCUR: DUE TO THE USE OF A NON-QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC. LENS DELIVERY PERFORMANCE MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED WHEN USING OTHER NON-QUALIFIED VISCOELASTICS LEADING TO UNDERFILL, OVERFILL, MISFOLDING , DELIVERY ISSUES AND /OR DAMAGE. IF INADEQUATE VISCOELASTIC IS PLACED IN THE DEVICE THIS WILL CAUSE INADEQUATE COVERAGE OF THE LENS FOLD PATH WHICH MAY CAUSE THE LENS TO ADVANCE INCORRECTLY AND CAUSE DELIVERY ISSUES AND /OR DAMAGE. IF THE OPERATING ROOM TEMPERATURE IS TOO HIGH (> 23°C / 73° F) LENS FOLDING CONSISTENCY IS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED, THE LENS IS MORE ADHERENT AND THIS MAY INHIBIT LENS ADVANCEMENT AND CAUSE DELIVERY ISSUES AND / OR PRODUCT DAMAGE. ANY OF THE ABOVE LISTED CAUSES ALONE, OR IN COMBINATION, MAY CREATE THE REPORTED EVENT. IN ADDITION TO THIS, ALL IOLS ARE 100% COSMETICALLY INSPECTED AS PER APPROVED MANUFACTURING PROCEDURES AND THE OBSERVED LENS DAMAGE WOULD NOT MEET OUR CURRENT RELEASE CRITERIA. BASED ON THESE INVESTIGATION FINDINGS, WE ARE UNABLE TO VERIFY IF THE IOL CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT. BASED ON THE RESULTS FROM THE PRODUCT HISTORY RECORD, THE PRODUCTS MET RELEASE CRITERIA.

THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE WAS RECEIVED BASED ON LITERATURE REVIEW. ARTICLE: TWO-YEAR RESULTS AFTER COMBINED PHACOEMULSIFICATION AND IRIS-FIXATED PHAKIC INTRAOCULAR LENS REMOVAL. A RETROSPECTIVE STUDY WAS DONE TO DESCRIBE THE SURGICAL TECHNIQUE OF PERFORMING CATARACT SURGERY UNDERNEATH THE PHAKIC INTRAOCULAR LENS (PIOL) IN PATIENTS, PREVIOUSLY TREATED WITH AN (TORIC) ARTISAN OR ARTIFEX (OPHTEC BV) IRIS-FIXATED PHAKIC INTRAOCULAR LENS (IF-PIOL) AND PRESENT THE SAFETY AND VISUAL AND REFRACTIVE OUTCOMES OF THIS PROCEDURE. A TOTAL OF 59 EYES OF 40 PATIENTS UNDERWENT SINGLE INCISION TECHNIQUE (SIT) FOR COMBINED CATARACT SURGERY AND PIOL EXPLANTATION. THE PATIENTS WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: MYOPIC EYES (N=50) AND HYPEROPIC EYES (N=9). THE IOL MODEL CHOSEN FOR IMPLANTATION INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: TECNIS ZCB00, PCB00, OR ZA9003, AND SENSAR AR40 (JOHNSON &JOHNSON); ACRYSOF MA60MA AND SA60AT (ALCON); OR BIGBAG (CARL ZEISS MEDITEC AG). THE HEALON (JOHNSON & JOHNSON VISION SURGICAL) OPHTHALMIC VISCOSURGICAL DEVICE (OVD) WAS ALSO USED DURING CATARACT SURGERY AND INJECTED INTO THE ANTERIOR CHAMBER TO SEPARATE THE PIOL FROM THE CRYSTALLINE LENS. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE POSTOPERATIVE REFRACTIVE CYLINDER OF 17 EYES WERE NOT WITHIN =1.00 D. OVERALL POSTOPERATIVE ENDOTHELIAL CELL DENSITY (ECD) LOSS WAS -5.4 ± 11.8% AFTER 6 MONTHS AND -9.4±17.0% AFTER 6¿24 MONTHS WHICH WAS INTERPRETED TO BE AS A RESULT OF SURGICAL TRAUMA. THE POSTOPERATIVE SPHERICAL EQUIVALENT OF ONE EYE DEVIATED -1.78 D FROM TARGET REFRACTION IN WHICH THE PATIENT RECEIVED AN ADDITIONAL TORIC IF-PIOL 3 MONTHS AFTER SINGLE INCISION TECHNIQUE (SIT). CATARACT SURGERY WAS COMPLICATED BY A POSTERIOR CAPSULAR RUPTURE IN THREE EYES OF WHICH TWO EYES WITH VITREOUS LOSS. ONE MYOPIC PATIENT PRESENTED WITH A RHEGMATOGENOUS RETINAL DETACHMENT IN ONE EYE WITHIN 2 YEARS AFTER THE SIT PROCEDURE.

A PHYSICIAN REPORTED THAT, AFTER INTRAOCULAR LENS IMPLANT PROCEDURE, A SCRATCH WAS FOUND ON THE IOL OPTIC THAT WAS VISUALLY CONFIRMED. THE SURGERY WAS COMPLETED WITHOUT PRODUCT REPLACEMENT. THERE WAS NO HARM TO THE PATIENT. THE PRODUCT WAS NOT RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS; THE LENS REMAINS IMPLANTED. VIDEO WAS PROVIDED AND THE REPORTED COMPLAINT WAS OBSERVED. VIDEO PROVIDED SHOWS IOL IMPLANTATION. IOL APPEARS TO BE IN THE CORRECT POSITION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT. POST IMPLANTATION A SLIGHT MARK IS VISIBLE OVER THE OPTIC EDGE AREA AT AROUND 2 O'CLOCK POSITION. ALSO A MARK IS OBSERVED OVER THE OPTIC AREA, THE MARK IS WHITE IN APPEARANCE , NO DETERMINATION CAN BE MADE IF THE MARK IS ON THE SURFACE OF THE IOL, OR IT IS A SCRATCH WITHIN THE MATERIAL OF THE LENS. THE PRODUCT INVESTIGATION COULD NOT IDENTIFY THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE REPORTED COMPLAINT "SCRATCH ON OPTIC". LENS DAMAGE MAY OCCUR: DUE TO THE USE OF A NON-QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC. LENS DELIVERY PERFORMANCE MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED WHEN USING OTHER NON-QUALIFIED VISCOELASTICS LEADING TO UNDERFILL, OVERFILL, MISFOLDING , DELIVERY ISSUES AND /OR DAMAGE. IF INADEQUATE VISCOELASTIC IS PLACED IN THE DEVICE THIS WILL CAUSE INADEQUATE COVERAGE OF THE LENS FOLD PATH WHICH MAY CAUSE THE LENS TO ADVANCE INCORRECTLY AND CAUSE DELIVERY ISSUES AND /OR DAMAGE. IF THE OPERATING ROOM TEMPERATURE IS TOO HIGH (> 23°C / 73° F) LENS FOLDING CONSISTENCY IS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED, THE LENS IS MORE ADHERENT AND THIS MAY INHIBIT LENS ADVANCEMENT AND CAUSE DELIVERY ISSUES AND / OR PRODUCT DAMAGE. ANY OF THE ABOVE LISTED CAUSES ALONE, OR IN COMBINATION, MAY CREATE THE REPORTED EVENT. IN ADDITION TO THIS, ALL IOLS ARE 100% COSMETICALLY INSPECTED AS PER APPROVED MANUFACTURING PROCEDURES AND THE OBSERVED LENS DAMAGE WOULD NOT MEET OUR CURRENT RELEASE CRITERIA. BASED ON THESE INVESTIGATION FINDINGS, WE ARE UNABLE TO VERIFY IF THE IOL CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT. BASED ON THE RESULTS FROM THE PRODUCT HISTORY RECORD, THE PRODUCTS MET RELEASE CRITERIA. THERE HAVE BEEN NO OTHER COMPLAINTS REPORTED IN THE LOT NUMBER. THE MANUFACTURER INTERNAL REFERENCE NUMBER IS: (B)(4).

A PHYSICIAN REPORTED THAT DURING A CATARACT SURGERY WITH INTRAOCULAR LENS (IOL) IMPLANT PROCEDURE, WHEN THE SURGEON TRIED TO INSERT THE LENS AFTER SETTING WITH OPHTHALMIC VISCOSURGICAL DEVICES (OVD), IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT THE BEHAVIOR OF THE IOL WAS UNSTABLE. THE PLUNGER PASSED OVER THE OPTICAL PART AND THE IOL OPTICAL PART HAD A CRACK. THE IOL WAS CUT IN HALF, REMOVED IT OUT OF THE EYE AND THE SURGERY WAS COMPLETED AFTER REPLACING THE ANOTHER BACKUP ONE. THE DEVICE AND THE LENS WERE RETURNED SEPARATELY IN THE OPENED BLISTER TRAY INSIDE THE OPENED CARTON. THE LENS STOP AND PLUNGER LOCK WERE REMOVED. THE PLUNGER WAS ORIENTED CORRECTLY. VISCOELASTIC WAS OBSERVED IN THE DEVICE. BLOOD WAS OBSERVED DRIED AT THE NOZZLE TIP. THE PLUNGER WAS RETRACTED TO MID-NOZZLE. THE LENS WAS RETURNED INSIDE A FOLDED PIECE OF WHITE GAUZE. VISCOELASTIC AND BLOOD WERE DRIED ON THE LENS. THE OPTIC WAS CUT OR TORN INTO TWO PORTIONS. ONE OPTIC PORTION WAS TORN AND GOUGED ON THE ANTERIOR SURFACE. PRODUCT HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED AND DOCUMENTATION INDICATED THE PRODUCT MET RELEASE CRITERIA. A QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC WAS INDICATED. THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE REPORTED COMPLAINT CANNOT BE DETERMINED. THE USED DEVICE AND THE DAMAGED LENS WERE RETURNED SEPARATELY. THE OPTIC WAS TORN AND GOUGED, INTERPRETED AS THE COMPLAINT. THE PLUNGER WAS RETRACTED. THE PLUNGER POSITION IN RELATION TO THE LENS DURING ADVANCEMENT CANNOT BE DETERMINED. THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU) INSTRUCTS: AFTER THE LENS HAS BEEN ADVANCED TO THE NOZZLE LINE, THE LENS SHOULD BE VISUALLY INSPECTED TO DETERMINE THE POSITION OF THE HAPTICS. THE PLUNGER SHOULD BE IN CONTACT WITH THE TRAILING OPTIC EDGE. AFTER CONFIRMING THE LENS IS PROPERLY POSITIONED AND THE HAPTICS ARE FOLDED PROPERLY, PROCEED WITH LENS IMPLANTATION. PROCEEDING WITH IMPLANTATION OF A MISFOLDED HAPTIC OR A LENS THAT APPEARS TO BE ¿OUT OF POSITION¿ CAN RESULT IN A BROKEN HAPTIC OR OTHER NEGATIVE OUTCOME, SINCE THE HAPTIC MAY BE TRAPPED AND STRETCHED, AND/OR PINCHED AND SHEARED BY THE MOVING PLUNGER. A QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC WAS INDICATED. PLUNGER OVERRIDE MAY OCCUR: DUE TO RAPID ADVANCEMENT FASTER THAN THE IFU RECOMMEND RATE. DUE TO THE USE OF A NON-QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC. MATERIAL PROPERTIES OF NON-QUALIFIED OVDS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO UNDERFILL, OVERFILL, MISFOLDING OF THE HAPTICS, OR OTHER INCONSISTENT FOLDING OUTCOMES. IF INADEQUATE VISCOELASTIC IS PLACED IN THE DEVICE THIS WILL CAUSE INADEQUATE COVERAGE OF THE LENS FOLD PATH WHICH MAY CAUSE THE LENS TO ADVANCE INCORRECTLY OR BECOME ¿STUCK¿ IN THE DEVICE ALLOWING THE PLUNGER TO OVERRIDE THE LENS. IF THE DEVICE IS OVERFILLED WITH OVD, THIS CAN PREVENT THE TRAILING HAPTIC FROM BEING PLACED PROPERLY OR MOVE THE LENS OUT OF POSITION RESULTING IN MISFOLDING. IF THE OPERATING ROOM TEMPERATURE IS TOO HIGH (> 23°C / 73° F) LENS FOLDING CONSISTENCY IS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED, THE LENS IS MORE ADHERENT AND THIS MAY INHIBIT LENS ADVANCEMENT. ANY OF THE ABOVE LISTED CAUSES ALONE, OR IN COMBINATION, MAY CREATE THE REPORTED EVENT. THE MANUFACTURER INTERNAL REFERENCE NUMBER IS: (B)(4).

A REVIEW OF THE DEVICE/LOT HISTORY RECORD AND HISTORICAL DATA ANALYSIS FOR THIS DEVICE WILL BE PERFORMED. UPON COMPLETION OF THE REVIEW, IF THERE IS ANY FURTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION A SUPPLEMENTAL MEDWATCH REPORT WILL BE FILED. ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO CONTACT THE CUSTOMER ACCOUNT REQUESTING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING COMPLAINT HOWEVER, TO DATE NO RESPONSE HAS BEEN RECEIVED. ALL PERTINENT INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO JOHNSON & JOHNSON SURGICAL VISION, INC. HAS BEEN SUBMITTED. IT WAS REPORTED THE INTRAOCULAR LENS (IOL) WAS IMPLANTED IN THE PATIENT¿S OCULAR SINISTER (LEFT EYE). THE IOL WAS REMOVED IN A SEPARATE SURGICAL PROCEDURE DUE TO MECHANICAL COMPLICATIONS AND REPLACED WITH THE SAME MODEL LENS WITH A DIFFERENT DIOPTER SIZE, DIB00 22.5 DIOPTER. THERE WAS NO INCISION ENLARGEMENT, NO SUTURE(S), NO VITRECTOMY, AND NO INJURY. PATIENT TOLERATED THE PROCEDURE WELL. THE IOL IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR RETURN AS IT WAS DISCARDED. NO FURTHER INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE.
A SAMPLE DEVICE WAS NOT RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS. PRODUCT HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED AND DOCUMENTATION INDICATED THE PRODUCT MET RELEASE CRITERIA. ROOT CAUSE HAS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED. THERE HAVE BEEN NO OTHER COMPLAINTS REPORTED IN THE LOT NUMBER. THE MANUFACTURER INTERNAL REFERENCE NUMBER IS: (B)(4). A NON-HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL REPORTED THAT FOLLOWING AN INTRAOCULAR LENS (IOL) IMPLANT PROCEDURE, THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED BLURRED VISION WITH FLOATERS AND A CLINICAL REASON FOR EXPLANT OF SUBLUXATION OF LENS. THE IOL WAS EXCHANGED IN A SECONDARY PROCEDURE FOLLOWING THE INITIAL PROCEDURE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN REQUESTED.
A NURSE REPORTED THAT DURING THE INTRAOCULAR LENS (IOL) IMPLANTATION THE INJECTOR FAILED. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN REQUESTED AND PROVIDED THAT THERE WAS A PATIENT CONTACT BUT, NO PATIENT HARM AND NO HOSPITALIZATION. . THE DEVICE WITH THE LENS WAS RETURNED LOOSE IN A LARGE BIOHAZARD BAG. THE PLUNGER LOCK AND LENS STOP HAVE BEEN REMOVED. THE PLUNGER WAS ORIENTED CORRECTLY. VISCOELASTIC WAS OBSERVED IN THE DEVICE. THE PLUNGER HAS ADVANCED BEYOND MID-NOZZLE AND HAS UNDERRODE THE LENS. THE LENS WAS LOCATED IN THE NOZZLE ENTRY AREA. THE TRAILING HAPTIC WAS MISFOLDED UNDERNEATH THE OPTIC ALONG THE LEFT SIDE OF THE PLUNGER. THE LEADING HAPTIC WAS POSITIONED ON TOP OF THE PLUNGER. THE OPTIC WAS ON THE PLUNGER AND SLIGHTLY ROTATED. THE TRAILING OPTIC PORTION WAS FOLDED UNDER AND BROKEN. THE NOZZLE WAS REMOVED AND CLEANED FOR FURTHER EVALUATION. THE LENS WAS REMOVED DURING CLEANING. TOP COAT DYE STAIN TESTING WAS CONDUCTED WITH ACCEPTABLE RESULTS. PRODUCT HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED AND THE DOCUMENTATION INDICATED THE PRODUCT MET RELEASE CRITERIA. A QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC WAS INDICATED. THERE ARE NO OTHER COMPLAINTS IN THIS LOT. THE ROOT CAUSE CANNOT BE DETERMINED FOR THE REPORTED COMPLAINT. A PLUNGER UNDERRIDE WAS OBSERVED. THE PLUNGER UNDERRIDE WAS MOST LIKELY INTERPRETED AS THE REPORTED COMPLAINT. A QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC WAS INDICATED. PLUNGER UNDERRIDE MAY OCCUR: DUE TO RAPID ADVANCEMENT FASTER THAN THE IFU RECOMMEND RATE. IF INADEQUATE VISCOELASTIC IS PLACED IN THE DEVICE, THIS WILL CAUSE INADEQUATE COVERAGE OF THE LENS FOLD PATH WHICH MAY CAUSE THE LENS TO ADVANCE INCORRECTLY OR BECOME ¿STUCK¿ IN THE DEVICE ALLOWING THE PLUNGER TO UNDERRIDE THE LENS. IF THE DEVICE IS OVERFILLED WITH OPHTHALMIC VISCOELASTIC DEVICES (OVD), THIS CAN PREVENT THE TRAILING HAPTIC FROM BEING PLACED PROPERLY OR MOVE THE LENS OUT OF POSITION RESULTING IN MISFOLDING. IF THE OPERATING ROOM TEMPERATURE IS TOO HIGH (> 23°C / 73° F) LENS FOLDING CONSISTENCY IS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED, THE LENS IS MORE ADHERENT AND THIS MAY INHIBIT LENS ADVANCEMENT. ANY OF THE ABOVE LISTED CAUSES ALONE, OR IN COMBINATION, MAY CREATE THE REPORTED EVENT. TOP COAT DYE STAIN TESTING WAS CONDUCTED WITH ACCEPTABLE RESULTS. THE MANUFACTURER INTERNAL REFERENCE NUMBER IS: (B)(4).

IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT IS NOT ABLE TO READ ROAD SIGNS, FEELS A FILM ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT SIDE OF HER EYE, BLURRY VISION, AND CAN NOT SEE DISTANCE. WITH INTRAOCULAR LENS (IOL). THROUGH FOLLOW-UP, IT WAS LEARNED THE PATIENT STILL HAS BLURRY ISSUES AND FEELS SOMETHING IN HER EYE LIKE THERE IS A FILM ON THE BOTTOM OF HER RIGHT EYE. THE PATIENT EXPLAINED THAT SHE HAS STOPPED DRIVING, BECAUSE SHE IS UNABLE TO READ THE ROAD SIGNS, SEE ROAD CONSTRUCTION, OR CHANGE LANES VERY WELL. THEREFORE, THE PATIENT DECIDED TO STOP DRIVING SINCE HER VISION HAS GONE DOWNHILL. ON (B)(6) 2022 (2 DAYS POST-OPERATIVE), THE PATIENT WAS ABLE TO SEE THE CLOCK ON HER OVEN 6-8 FEET AWAY AND VISION WAS FINE. HOWEVER, ON (B)(6) 2022, THE PATIENT NOTICED SHE COULD NOT SEE VERY WELL AND HAD TO BE 2 FEET FROM THE OVEN JUST TO READ THE CLOCK ON HER OVEN. IN THE 1 WEEK FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENT ON (B)(6) 2022, THE SURGEON TOLD HER THE LENS LOOKED FINE, VISUAL ACUITY WAS 20/40, AND EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT. THE PATIENT EXPLAINED HER VISUAL ISSUES, HOWEVER, SHE FEELS HER DOCTOR DISMISSED HER COMPLAINTS AND REFERRED HER TO ANOTHER DOCTOR. THE SURGEON EXPLAINED TO THE PATIENT HOW THE LENS IS DESIGNED, THEREFORE, MAY BE FEELING THE LENS AND THAT IT MAY TAKE TIME FOR HER EYE TO FOCUS, BUT THIS WOULD BE THE BEST VISION SHE WOULD GET. ON (B)(6) 2022, A SECOND DOCTOR SAID THE SAME AS HE DID NOT SEE ANY ISSUES WITH THE LENS. THE PATIENT TRIED TO ASK IF THE LENS WOULD BE CAUSING THAT FILM FEELING, BUT THE DOCTOR DID NOT KNOW. THE DOCTOR SUGGESTED THE PATIENT SEE A RETINA SPECIALIST FOR FURTHER EVALUATION. ON (B)(6) 2022, THE RETINA SPECIALIST STATED THERE IS SOME SWELLING IN HER RIGHT EYE AND PRESCRIBED HER NEW MEDICATION, DUREZOL DROPS, REFRESH DROPS FOR DRY EYE. HER FIRST DOCTOR TOLD HER SHE DID NOT HAVE DRY EYES AND QUESTIONED WHY SHE NEEDED REFRESH DROPS, BUT SHE KNEW SHE HAD A HISTORY OF DRY EYES BASED ON WHAT HER OPTOMETRIST TOLD HER. SINCE USING THE MEDICATION, THE PATIENT IS FEELING A LITTLE BETTER, BUT STILL FEELS LIKE SOMETHING IS IN HER EYE AND HAS BLURRINESS. THE PATIENT HAS HAD NO OTHER TREATMENTS. THE PATIENT BRIEFLY MENTIONED SHE IS DIABETIC, BUT THE DIABETES HAS NOT AFFECTED HER EYE SIGHT AND THAT SHE WAS TOLD A WHILE BACK THAT SHE HAS A VERY MINOR WRINKLE IN HER EYE.

A NURSE REPORTED FOLLOWING AN INTRAOCULAR LENS IMPLANT PROCEDURE, THE PATIENT COULD NOT SEE WELL READING OR DISTANCE. NEAR VISION TARGET NOT NEAR ENOUGH FOR HER NEEDS. THE LENS WAS LATER EXCHANGED IN A SECONDARY PROCEDURE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN REQUESTED AND RECEIVED WHICH STATES THAT THIS LENS ISSUE WAS DISCOVERED (B)(6) 2021. PATIENT WAS A CONTACT LENS WEARER. SHE WAS A +2.00 HYPEROPE. SHE USED THIS LEFT EYE FOR NEAR FOR MONOVISION. WE CALCULATED FOR HER A RESIDUAL OF -1.88 WITH THE BARRETT FORMULA. SHE ENDED UP ONE MONTH POST OP ON (B)(6) 2021 WITH A REFRACTION OF PLANO-0.75X085 = 20/30. HER SURGERY WAS ROUTINE WITH NO COMPLICATIONS. THE LENS LOADED EASILY, OPENED EASILY IN THE EYE AND CENTERED WELL. POST OPERATIVELY SHE COMPLAINED OF DECREASED NEAR VISION. HER ORIGINAL K READINGS AVERAGE WAS 47.46 AND POST OP THREE MONTHS WAS 47.27 SO HER LACK OF NEAR VISION WAS NOT DUE TO A DRAMATIC CHANGE IN K READINGS. THE ISSUE THERE FOR WAS SIMPLY BETWEEN THE DESIRED AND ACHIEVED REFRACTIVE ERROR.

IT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED THAT ENDOPHTHALMITIS DEVELOPED IN A PATIENT¿S RIGHT EYE THREE MONTHS AFTER THE CATARACT SURGERY. THE PRIMARY OPERATION WAS COMPLETED WITH NO PROBLEMS, BUT ENDOPHTHALMITIS DEVELOPED, AND VITREOUS SURGERY WAS PERFORMED BY WHICH THE INFLAMMATION HAD SUBSIDED SINCE THEN. IT WAS NOTED THAT THE PATIENT COMPLAINED OF EYE PAIN. THE REPORTING PHYSICIAN DID NOT THINK MUCH ABOUT THE RELATION OF THIS ISSUE TO THE INTRAOCULAR LENS AT FIRST BECAUSE A CULTURE TEST PERFORMED, AND NO BACTERIA WAS FOUND IN THE EYE; HOWEVER, HE THOUGHT THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY LATE-ONSET OF TOXIC ANTERIOR SEGMENT SYNDROME (TASS) WHILE STUDYING THE EVENT. REPORTEDLY, THE PATIENTS GO TO THE HOSPITAL FOR DOCTOR VISIT AND TREATMENT ON A REGULAR BASIS. IT WAS NOTED THAT ENDOPHTHALMITIS HAD NOT DEVELOPED IN THE CLINIC BEFORE AND THAT ON THE DAY OF SURGERY, FIVE PATIENTS INCLUDING THIS PATIENT, ALL HAD CATARACT SURGERY. NO OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS ON THE SAME DAY OF SURGERY WERE REPORTED. IT WAS REPORTED THAT PCR (POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION) WAS PERFORMED WHICH THERE WERE NO MICROORGANISMS (BACTERIA) FOUND, THAT THE CAUSATIVE ORGANISM HAS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED BY LUCIPUL PCR AND BACTERIAL INFECTION IS NOT SUSPECTED EVEN IN INTRAOPERATIVE FUNDUS FINDINGS. NO FURTHER INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED. PHONE NUMBER: (B)(6). DEVICE EVALUATION: THE PRODUCT TESTING COULD NOT BE PERFORMED AS THE PRODUCT WAS NOT RETURNED (THE LENS REMAINS IMPLANTED). THE REPORTED COMPLAINT CANNOT BE CONFIRMED. MANUFACTURING RECORD EVALUATION: THE MANUFACTURING RECORDS FOR THE DEVICE WERE REVIEWED.

THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE WAS RECEIVED BASED ON LITERATURE REVIEW. ARTICLE: INFLUENCE OF FROSTED HAPTICS ON ROTATIONAL STABILITY OF TORIC INTRAOCULAR LENSES A RETROSPECTIVE STUDY WAS DONE TO COMPARE TECNIS TORIC-I (CONVENTIONAL MODEL) AND TORIC-II (NEW MODEL) IOLS, IN TERMS OF UNFOLDING PROPERTY AND SURGICAL OUTCOMES. A TOTAL OF 131 EYES OF 99 PATIENTS WITH CATARACT UNDERWENT PHACOEMULSIFICATION AND TORIC IOL IMPLANTATION. TWO MODELS OF TECNIS TORIC IOLS WERE USED: TORIC IOL (TORIC-I IOL, ZCV) (N=70 EYES) AND TORIC II IOL (TORIC-II IOL, ZCW) (61 EYES) (JOHNSON & JOHNSON VISION CARE, INC.). DURING THE PROCEDURE, THE IOLS WERE SET IN THE INJECTOR CARTRIDGE (UNFOLDER PLATINUM INJECTOR, JOHNSON & JOHNSON VISION CARE, INC.) WITH AN OPHTHALMIC VISCOELASTIC DEVICE (SODIUM HYALURONATE 1.0%, HEALON, JOHNSON & JOHNSON VISION CARE, INC.). REPOSITIONING SURGERY TO CORRECT MAJOR AXIS MISALIGNMENT WAS PERFORMED IN 2 EYES IN THE TORIC-I IOL GROUP WITH A MISALIGNMENT OF 42 DEGREES AND 37 DEGREES, 14 DAYS AFTER THE PRIMARY CATARACT SURGERY. SURGICAL RESULTS AT 3 MONTHS POSTOPERATIVELY SHOWS THAT THE AMOUNT OF RESIDUAL MANIFEST ASTIGMATISM WAS SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER IN THE TORIC-II IOL THAN IN THE TORIC-I IOL GROUPS (P = 0.018). THE EYES IMPLANTED WITH TORIC-II IOL PRESENTED SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER AMOUNT OF AXIS MISALIGNMENT FROM THE INTENDED AXIS THAN THOSE RECEIVED TORIC-I IOL (P = 0.04). THE PERCENTAGE OF EYES WITH MISALIGNMENT OF > 10° WAS SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER WITH TORIC-II IOLS THAN WITH TORIC-I IOLS (P = 0.0044).

A SAMPLE DEVICE WAS NOT RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS. PRODUCT HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED AND DOCUMENTATION INDICATED THE PRODUCT MET RELEASE CRITERIA. ROOT CAUSE HAS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED. THERE HAVE BEEN NO OTHER COMPLAINTS REPORTED IN THE LOT NUMBER. THE MANUFACTURER INTERNAL REFERENCE NUMBER IS: (B)(4). A NON-HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL REPORTED THAT POST INTRAOCULAR LENS (IOL) IMPLANT PROCEDURE, THE LENS WAS EXPLANTED DUE TO DISPLACEMENT OF IOL. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS RECEIVED AND PROVIDED AS THE PATIENT DEVELOPED A CATARACT FOLLOWING A PREVIOUSLY PERFORMED RETINAL DETACHMENT REPAIR. CATARACT SURGERY WAS COMPLICATED BY A POSTERIOR CAPSULE BREACH. COMPANY LENS PLACEMENT WAS INDICATED AND A 3- PIECE COMPANY LENS IMPLANTED. UPON INSERTION, DAMAGE TO THE TRAILING HAPTIC WAS IDENTIFIED. IT WAS OPTED BY THE SURGEON TO LEAVE THE LENS IN PLACE AS IT APPEARED CENTERED AND OPERATING ROOM STAFF EXPRESSED UNFAMILIARITY IN LOADING A 3-PIECE IOL INTO THE INSERTER (HIGH LIKELIHOOD OF DAMAGING ANOTHER LENS IF ATTEMPTED). POSTOPERATIVELY, THE IOL REMAINED CENTERED FOR FOUR SUBSEQUENT POST OPERATIVE VISITS WITH UNCORRECTED VISUAL ACUITY IN THE 20/25-20/30 RANGE. ON (B)(6) 2022, PATIENT PRESENTED WITH DECREASED VISION TO 20/50 FOR APPROXIMATELY 1 WEEK DURATION. EXAMINATION REVEALED AN INFERIORLY DISPLACED IOL WITH THE OPTIC RIM WITHIN THE PUPIL MARGIN. PATIENT ELECTED TO UNDERGO IOL EXCHANGE. AS CAPSULE/ZOLUNAR SUPPORT COULD NOT BE VERIFIED, THE COMPANY IOL WAS REPLACED WITH AN ANTERIOR CHAMBER LENS ON 2/3/22. PATIENT IS RECOVERING WELL WITH UNCORRECTED 20/50 VISION AT THE LAST OFFICE VISIT ON 3/9/22. THERE REMAIN TWO SUTURES IN THE CORNEAL INCISION, AS WELL AS 2+ POSTERIOR CAPSULE OPACIFICATION IN THE VISUAL AXIS ACCOUNTING FOR THIS VISION. ACUITY IS EXPECTED TO FURTHER IMPROVE FOLLOWING REMOVAL OF REMAINING SUTURES AND YAG CAPSULOTOMY OF OPACIFIED CAPSULE. DOCTOR SAID THE ISSUES RELATED TO IMPROPER LOADING AND INSERTION OF THESE LENSES. I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS WILL BE A PROBLEM IN THE FUTURE. IT IS UNCLEAR IF THE HAPTIC DAMAGE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE IOL DECENTRATION, OR SIMPLY INADEQUATE IOL SUPPORT IN AN EYE THAT HAD UNDERGONE MULTIPLE SURGERIES.

A HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL REPORTED FOLLOWING THE IMPLANTATION OF THE SHUNT, AFTER THREE YEARS OF THE SURGERY LEFT EYE SHOWED SIGNS OF BLEB FAILURE WITH A PROGRESSIVE INCREASE IN THE INTRAOCULAR LENS PRESSURE(IOP), REACHING (22 MMHG). A DETERIORATION IN THE VISUAL FIELD SCORES WAS OBSERVED. DUE TO THE FAILURE OF THE SURGERY IN THE LEFT EYE, A REVISION OF THE FILTERING BLEB WAS PERFORMED WITH GOOD INITIAL CONTROL OF THE IOP. ONE MONTH AFTER THE SURGERY, THE IOP WAS 17 MMHG, AND SUTURE LYSIS WAS DONE, REDUCING INTO 7 MMHG. THE FOLLOWING WEEK THE IOP ROSE TO 17 MMHG; THE BLEB WAS FLAT EXCEPT FOR THE PRESENCE OF THE COLLAGEN MATRIX; THE ANTERIOR CHAMBER WAS DEEP AND GONIOSCOPY SHOWED INCARCERATION OF TRANSLUCENT IRIS STROMA FILAMENTS TO THE LUMEN OF THE MINI SHUNT DEVICE, WITH AN ANTERIORIZATION OF THE UNDERLYING PIGMENTED IRIDIAN STROMA. NEODYMIUM-DOPED YTTRIUM ALUMINIUM GARNET (ND: YAG), LASER WAS PERFORMED AT THE TIP OF THE DEVICE. AN INCREASE IN BLEB HEIGHT AND EXTENSION WAS IMMEDIATELY SEEN AFTER THE TREATMENT AND A REDUCTION OF THE IOP TO 8 MMHG. LATER SHOWED STABILIZATION OF THE IOP AT 12 MMHG WITHOUT MEDICATION, AND THE MINI-SHUNT PERSISTED PERMEABLE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN REQUESTED. A SAMPLE WAS NOT RECEIVED AT THE MANUFACTURING SITE FOR EVALUATION; THEREFORE, THE CONDITION OF THE PRODUCT COULD NOT BE EVALUATED.

ON 22ND MARCH 2022, RAYNER INTRAOCULAR LENSES LIMITED RECEIVED NOTIFICATION FROM ITS (B)(4) DISTRIBUTOR OF AN EVENT THAT OCCURRED FOLLOWING IMPLANTATION OF A RAYONE ASPHERIC RAO600C. THE EVENT DESCRIPTION PROVIDED STATES THAT THE INTENDED POST-OPERATIVE REFRACTIVE OUTCOME WAS -0.05 D AND THEIR POST-OPERATIVE OUTCOME IS -5.25 D. THE REFERENCE (B)(4) HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THIS CASE BY RAYNER. THE EVENT DESCRIPTION PROVIDED STATES THAT THE INTENDED POST-OPERATIVE REFRACTIVE OUTCOME WAS -0.05 D AND THEIR POST-OPERATIVE OUTCOME IS -5.25 D. THE PRE AND POST-OPERATIVE BIOMETRY WAS PROVIDED TO RAYNER FOR REVIEW. A REVIEW WAS PERFORMED BY RAYNER'S OPTICS TEAM AND IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE REFRACTIVE OUTCOME WAS MOST CONSISTENT WITH A +31.0D LENS. A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF ALL BATCHES GOING THROUGH MANUFACTURE AT THE SAME TIME AS THE SUBJECT RAYONE ASPHERIC RAO600C +22.5 D BATCH 021164466 WAS PERFORMED BY RAYNER. WHILE THE REVIEW IDENTIFIED THAT BATCHES OF +31.0 D WERE GOING THROUGH MANUFACTURE AT THE SAME TIME AS THE SUBJECT RAO600C +22.5 D BATCH, A REVIEW OF EACH CLEANROOM OPERATION SHOWS THAT EQUIVALENT OPERATIONS WERE PERFORMED IN SEPARATE AREAS AND BY SEPARATE TECHNICIANS. WHEN OPERATIONS WERE PERFORMED BY THE SAME TECHNICIAN, THEY WERE PERFORMED AT LEAST 24 HOURS APART WITH FULL RECONCILIATION AND LINE CLEARANCE CHECKS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY WITHOUT INCIDENT. OUR REVIEW HAS IDENTIFIED NO MECHANISM BY WHICH A POSSIBLE LENS CROSS-OVER COULD HAVE OCCURRED DURING MANUFACTURE. THE DEVICE IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR RETURN TO RAYNER. THE RAYONE ASPHERIC RAO600C IOL REMAINS IMPLANTED. A REVIEW OF OUR VIGILANCE DATA CONFIRMS THAT THIS IS AN ISOLATED INCIDENT. ALL LENSES FROM THIS BATCH HAVE BEEN SOLD AND NO OTHER INCIDENTS, OF ANY TYPE, HAVE BEEN RECEIVED AGAINST THE RAYONE ASPHERIC RAO600C BATCH 021164466. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF A DEVICE-RELATED CAUSE FOR THE REFRACTIVE OUTCOME IN THIS CASE. THE REFRACTIVE OUTCOME IS UNEXPLAINED. "DEVIATION IN TARGET REFRACTION" IS LISTED IN THE "ADVERSE EVENTS" SECTION OF RAYNER IFUS.
A HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL REPORTED DURING THE INTRAOCULAR LENS IMPLANTATION PLASTIC MATERIAL AND PLASTIC FIBER HAVE BEEN FOUND ON THE LENS. THE LENS WAS REMOVED FROM THE EYE IS THE SAME PROCEDURE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN REQUESTED AND RECEIVED STATING THAT THE FIBERS ON THE POSTERIOR SURFACE OF THE LENS AFTER IMPLANTATION MIGHT HAVE COME FROM THE CARTRIDGES. A SAMPLE DEVICE WAS NOT RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS. COMPLAINT HISTORY AND PRODUCT HISTORY RECORDS COULD NOT BE REVIEWED BECAUSE THE REPORTER DID NOT PROVIDE A LOT NUMBER OR ANY IDENTIFICATION TRACEABLE TO THE MANUFACTURING DOCUMENTATION. ROOT CAUSE HAS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED. THE MANUFACTURER INTERNAL REFERENCE NUMBER IS: (B)(4).
THE REFERENCE (B)(4) HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THIS CASE BY RAYNER. THE EVENT DESCRIPTION PROVIDED STATES THAT ON AN UNSPECIFIED DATE POST-OPERATIVELY OPACIFICATION OF A RAYNER HYDROPHILIC ACRYLIC IOL (NO PRODUCT INFORMATION AVAILABLE). OPACIFICATION LED TO A DECLINE IN THE PATIENT'S VISUAL ACUITY AND THE LENS WAS EXPLANTED AND EXCHANGED. THE EXPLANTED IOL HAS NOT BEEN RETURNED TO RAYNER FOR EVALUATION. THE LOCATION OF THE EXPLANTED LENS IS NOT KNOWN BY RAYNER. PRIMARY CALCIFICATION IS INHERENT. IT IS DUE TO PARTICULAR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES OR PACKAGING INTERACTIONS. AN EXAMINATION OF THE LITERATURE SHOWS THAT SOME MANUFACTURERS HAVE HAD KNOWN CASES OF PRIMARY CALCIFICATION DUE TO AN INTERACTION WITH SILICONE IN THE PACKAGING - AND MORE RECENTLY, DUE TO PHOSPHATE REMNANTS (ORIGINATING FROM A DETERGENT) FOUND IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. RAYNER HAS MADE NO MATERIAL PROCESSING OR PACKAGING CHANGES THAT MAY HAVE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED OUR IOLS; WE HAVE NEVER HAD A CONFIRMED CASE OF PRIMARY CALCIFICATION RELATING TO A RAYNER IOL.

THE REFERENCE (B)(4) HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THIS CASE BY RAYNER. THE EVENT DESCRIPTION PROVIDED STATES THAT ON AN UNSPECIFIED DATE POST-OPERATIVELY OPACIFICATION OF A RAYNER HYDROPHILIC ACRYLIC IOL (NO PRODUCT INFORMATION AVAILABLE). OPACIFICATION LED TO A DECLINE IN THE PATIENT'S VISUAL ACUITY AND THE LENS WAS EXPLANTED AND EXCHANGED. THE EXPLANTED IOL HAS NOT BEEN RETURNED TO RAYNER FOR EVALUATION. THE LOCATION OF THE EXPLANTED LENS IS NOT KNOWN BY RAYNER. PRIMARY CALCIFICATION IS INHERENT. IT IS DUE TO PARTICULAR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES OR PACKAGING INTERACTIONS. AN EXAMINATION OF THE LITERATURE SHOWS THAT SOME MANUFACTURERS HAVE HAD KNOWN CASES OF PRIMARY CALCIFICATION DUE TO AN INTERACTION WITH SILICONE IN THE PACKAGING - AND MORE RECENTLY, DUE TO PHOSPHATE REMNANTS (ORIGINATING FROM A DETERGENT) FOUND IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. RAYNER HAS MADE NO MATERIAL PROCESSING OR PACKAGING CHANGES THAT MAY HAVE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED OUR IOLS; WE HAVE NEVER HAD A CONFIRMED CASE OF PRIMARY CALCIFICATION RELATING TO A RAYNER IOL. SECONDARY CALCIFICATION AFFECTS MANY MANUFACTURERS AND IS A PHENOMENON THAT IS NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD; IT IS KNOWN THAT IT STEMS FROM CHANGES IN THE EYE'S ENVIRONMENT DUE TO PATIENT COMORBIDITY, SECONDARY SURGERIES AND POTENTIALLY OTHER, POORLY UNDERSTOOD INTERACTIONS: OFF LABEL USE OF INTRACAMERAL ALTEPLASE (ACTILYSE) (RTPA), MULTIFACTORIAL, HIGH PHOSPHATE CONTENT OPHTHALMIC VISCOELASTIC DEVICES , REPEATED EXPOSURE TO INTRACAMERAL AIR, RAISED INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE, EXCESSIVE POST-OPERATIVE INFLAMMATION, COMPLICATED, TRAUMATISED EYES, AS A RESULT OF DIRECT CONTACT BETWEEN THE IOL SURFACE AND THE EXOGENOUS GAS OR SUBSTANCE, A METABOLIC CHANGE IN THE ANTERIOR CHAMBER DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF EXOGENOUS GAS/SUBSTANCE IN THE EYE OR AN EXACERBATED INFLAMMATORY REACTION AFTER MULTIPLE SURGICAL PROCEDURES, TRAUMA OR REPEAT SURGERY INVOLVED IN RE-BUBBLING POTENTIALLY DISRUPTING THE BLOOD AQUEOUS BARRIER, INCREASING CONCENTRATION OF CALCIUM IONS.

ON 23RD MARCH 2022, RAYNER INTRAOCULAR LENSES LIMITED RECEIVED NOTIFICATION FROM ITS BRAZILIAN DISTRIBUTOR OF AN EVENT THAT OCCURRED DURING USE OF A RAYONE TRIFOCAL RAO603F. THE EVENT DESCRIPTION PROVIDED STATES THAT IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING IMPLANTATION THE LENS WAS OBSERVED TO BE CUT AND OFF-CENTRE. AN ADDITIONAL SURGICAL PROCEDURE HAS BEEN SCHEDULED BY THE HEALTHCARE FACILITY TO EXPLANT AND EXCHANGE THE LENS. THE REFERENCE (B)(4) HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THIS CASE BY RAYNER. THE EVENT DESCRIPTION PROVIDED STATES THAT THE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING IMPLANTATION INTO THE EYE THE LENS WAS CUT AND THAT IT WAS OFF-CENTRE. THE LENS WAS LEFT IN SITU; HOWEVER, THE HEALTHCARE FACILITY HAS SCHEDULED AN ADDITIONAL SURGICAL PROCEDURE TO EXPLANT AND EXCHANGE THE RAO603F IOL. THE INFORMATION RECEIVED AT THIS STAGE DOES NOT IDENTIFY WHICH PART OF THE IOL WAS CUT. THE VERBATIM REPORT OF THE LENS BEING OFF-CENTRE IS SUGGESTIVE OF DAMAGE TO THE HAPTIC WHICH COULD IMPACT STABILITY/CENTRATION WITHIN THE CAPSULAR BAG. RAYNER HAS REQUESTED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION VIA ITS DISTRIBUTOR IN (B)(4) TO FACILITATE FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THE EVENT. THE DEVICE HAS NOT BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO RAYNER FOR EVALUATION. THE RAYNER RISK ANALYSIS IDENTIFIES THE FOLLOWING AS POSSIBLE CAUSES OF "TRAPPED/TORN LENS HAPTIC/OPTIC DURING INSERTION"; INADEQUATE AMOUNT OF VISCOELASTIC, INADEQUATE QUALITY OF VISCOELASTIC, HAPTIC TRAPPED BY PLUNGER OVERRIDE DUE TO FAST MOTION, USER OPENS CLOSED FLAPS AND CLOSES AGAIN BEFORE USE, PLUNGER ADVANCED TOO QUICKLY, INSERTION OF VISCOELASTIC THROUGH NOZZLE LEADING TO INADEQUATE AMOUNT OF VISCOELASTIC, USER REMOVED INJECTOR FROM TRAY PRIOR TO INSERTING VISCOELASTIC - CAUSING LENS TO BE IMPROPERLY PLACED IN CARTRIDGE, USER REMOVES INJECTOR FROM TRAY PRIOR TO CLOSING CARTRIDGE - RESULTING IN CARTRIDGE NOT BEING CLIPPED CLOSED PROPERLY AND OPTIC EDGE TRAPPED/DAMAGED ON CLOSURE OF CARTRIDGE.

THE FOLLOWING LITERATURE PUBLICATION WAS REVIEWED: ¿SCLERAL FIXATION USING A HYDROPHILIC FOUR-HAPTIC LENS AND POLYTETRAFLUOROETHYLENE SUTURE¿. THE ARTICLE WAS PUBLISHED ONLINE: (B)(6) 2021. ALL APHAKIC PATIENTS, AND THOSE WITH DISLOCATED OR SUBLUXED IOLS WITHOUT CAPSULAR SUPPORT, TREATED AT CLINICAL HOSPITAL OF RIBEIRÃO PRETO MEDICAL SCHOOL BETWEEN FEBRUARY AND MAY 2019 WERE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS STUDY. A TOTAL OF 20 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE CURRENT STUDY. THEIR MEAN AGE ± SD AT THE TIME OF SURGERY WAS 64 ± 10 YEARS (RANGE 39¿84 YEARS). THE STUDY SAMPLE INCLUDED 8 WOMEN (40%) AND 12 MEN (60%) AND THE EYES THAT UNDERWENT SURGERY WERE 9 RIGHT EYES (45%) AND 11 LEFT EYES (55%). THE NEEDLES OF THE 7-0 CV-8 GORE-TEX® SUTURE (WL GORE & ASSOCIATES, NEWARK, DE, USA) ARE DISCARDED, AND THE SUTURE THREAD IS CUT INTO TWO HALVES. EACH END OF THE GORE-TEX THREAD IS PASSED INTO THE ANTERIOR CHAMBER AND REMOVED FROM THE CORRESPONDING SCLEROTOMY USING FLAT INTRAOCULAR FORCEPS. IN ORDER TO AVOID POSTOPERATIVE HYPOTONY, LEAKING SCLEROTOMIES CAN BE SUTURED WITH 7-0 POLYGLACTIN 910 (VICRYL, ETHICON, NJ, USA). THE CORNEAL WOUND IS CLOSED USING 10-0 NYLON SUTURE. FINALLY, THE CONJUNCTIVAL PERITOMY IS ALSO CLOSED, ENSURING THAT THE EXTERNAL GORE-TEX THREAD IS COMPLETELY COVERED. NO INTRAOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS WERE NOTED. THE ARTICLE REPORTED GORE-TEX SUTURE, NOT THE KNOT, ERODED THE CONJUNCTIVA 7 DAYS AFTER SURGERY. THE SECOND MOST COMMON POSTOPERATIVE COMPLICATION FOUND IN THE PRESENT STUDY, AFTER CORNEAL EDEMA, WAS CONJUNCTIVAL EROSION WITH EXPOSURE OF THE GORE-TEX SUTURE. 8/20 (40%) PATIENTS EXHIBITED SUTURE EXPOSURE DURING THE 6 MONTHS OF FOLLOW-UP, DECREASING TO SIX CASES AFTER CONDUCTING PROCEDURES ON TWO OF THEM (THE EXPOSED TIP WAS CUT IN ONE CASE, AND THE CONJUNCTIVA WAS RESUTURED IN ANOTHER). AS FOR THE TYPE OF SUTURE, PROLENE HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN THE MOST FREQUENTLY USED THREAD FOR SCLERAL FIXATION. HOWEVER, DUE TO COMPLICATIONS RELATED TO THE THREAD, GORE-TEX SUTURE IS BEING USED MORE AND MORE FOR THIS PROCEDURE, AS IT PROVIDES ADVANTAGES SUCH AS GREATER RESISTANCE TO TRACTION AND SMALL MEMORY, WHICH FACILITATES MANIPULATION AND CAUSES A MINIMAL INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE. OTHER USED FOR EROSION. FROM THE DETAILS OF THE ARTICLE IT APPEARS THAT OUT OF A PATIENT POPULATION OF 20, THERE WAS 8 OCCURRENCES OF SUTURE EXPOSURE VIA EROSION, 2 OF WHICH REQUIRED REINTERVENTION. NO PATIENT SPECIFIC DETAILS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED. THEREFORE, THE PATIENT INITIALS REFLECT THE W.L. GORE INTERNAL CASE NUMBER. DATES OF THE EVENTS WERE REQUESTED, BUT NOT PROVIDED, THEREFORE THE DATE THE ARTICLE WAS AVAILABLE ON LINE (B)(6) 2021 WILL BE USED. REVIEW OF THE MANUFACTURING RECORDS AND ENGINEERING EVALUATION COULD NOT BE PERFORMED AS VALID LOT NUMBERS WERE NOT PROVIDED AND THE DEVICES WERE NOT RETURNED TO GORE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE EVENTS WERE REQUESTED FROM THE PHYSICIAN, BUT WERE NOT PROVIDED. PRODUCT IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION WAS NOT PROVIDED FOR THE DEVICES AND THE AUTHOR WAS CONTACTED MULTIPLE TIMES WITH NO RESPONSE. THE GORE-TEX® SUTURE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU) STATES: CONTRAINDICATIONS: THIS DEVICE IS CONTRAINDICATED FOR USE IN OPHTHALMIC SURGERY, MICROSURGERY, AND PERIPHERAL NEURAL TISSUE. WARNINGS: THE SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS SUTURE IN PERIPHERAL NEURAL, MICROSURGICAL AND OPHTHALMIC APPLICATIONS HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED. TISSUE INVASION OF THE GORE-TEX® SUTURE CAN RESULT IN ATTACHMENT OF THE SUTURE TO THE TISSUE IT PENETRATES. SUCH ATTACHMENT MAY MAKE REMOVAL OF THE GORE-TEX® SUTURE DIFFICULT. POSSIBLE ADVERSE REACTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF ANY SUTURE INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, TISSUE DEHISCENCE, INFECTION, LOCALIZED INFLAMMATORY REACTION, AND TRANSITORY LOCAL IRRITATION. BROKEN NEEDLES OR DAMAGED THREAD MAY RESULT IN EXTENDED OR ADDITIONAL SURGERY OR RETAINED FOREIGN BODIES.

THE REFERENCE (B)(4) HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THIS CASE BY RAYNER. THE EVENT DESCRIPTION PROVIDED STATES THAT OPACIFICATION OF THE IOL WAS OBSERVED FOR THE FIRST TIME 5 YEARS AND 10 MONTHS POST IOL IMPLANTATION. THE PATIENT UNDERWENT CATARACT SURGERY AND SUPERFLEX ASPHERIC 920H IOL IMPLANTATION ON (B)(6) 2008. IOL IMPLANTATION WAS NOT COMBINED WITH ANY OTHER OCULAR PROCEDURE AND IS REPORTED TO HAVE BEEN PERFORMED WITHOUT COMPLICATION. THE PATIENT MEDICAL HISTORY RECEIVED IDENTIFIED THAT THE PATIENT HAS FUCHS ENDOTHELIAL DYSTROPHY, DIABETES MELLITUS AND HYPERTENSION. POST IOL IMPLANTATION, THE PATIENT REQUIRED SEVERAL OCULAR PROCEDURES; YAG CAPSULOTOMY ON (B)(6) 2011, DESCEMET STRIPPING AUTOMATED ENDOTHELIAL KERATOPLASTY (DSAEK) ON (B)(6) 2013, RE-BUBBLING OF THE ANTERIOR CHAMBER WITH SF6 GAS ON (B)(6) 2013 AND REPEAT DSAEK ON (B)(6) 2013. OPACIFICATION WAS OBSERVED FOR THE FIRST TIME 5 YEARS AND 10 MONTHS FOLLOWING IOL IMPLANTATION AND 9 MONTHS FOLLOWING INSERTION OF SF6 GAS INTO THE ANTERIOR CHAMBER. OPACIFICATION LED TO A DECREASE IN THE PATIENT VISUAL ACUITY NECESSITATING LENS EXPLANTATION. LENS EXPLANTATION AND EXCHANGE WAS PERFORMED ON (B)(6) 2014. THE IOL IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR RETURN TO RAYNER. THE DEVICE HAS BEEN DISCARDED BY THE HEALTHCARE FACILITY. RAYNER IFUS CONTRAINDICATE "ACTIVE OCULAR DISEASES (CHRONIC SEVERE UVEITIS, PROLIFERATIVE DIABETIC RETINOPATHY, CHRONIC GLAUCOMA NOT RESPONSIVE TO MEDICATION") AND "CORNEAL DECOMPENSATION OR ENDOTHELIAL INSUFFICIENCY". PRIMARY CALCIFICATION IS INHERENT. IT IS DUE TO PARTICULAR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES OR PACKAGING INTERACTIONS. AN EXAMINATION OF THE LITERATURE SHOWS THAT SOME MANUFACTURERS HAVE HAD KNOWN CASES OF PRIMARY CALCIFICATION DUE TO AN INTERACTION WITH SILICONE IN THE PACKAGING - AND MORE RECENTLY, DUE TO PHOSPHATE REMNANTS (ORIGINATING FROM A DETERGENT) FOUND IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. RAYNER HAS MADE NO MATERIAL PROCESSING OR PACKAGING CHANGES THAT MAY HAVE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED OUR IOLS; WE HAVE NEVER HAD A CONFIRMED CASE OF PRIMARY CALCIFICATION RELATING TO A RAYNER IOL. SECONDARY CALCIFICATION AFFECTS MANY MANUFACTURERS AND IS A PHENOMENON THAT IS NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD; IT IS KNOWN THAT IT STEMS FROM CHANGES IN THE EYE'S ENVIRONMENT DUE TO PATIENT COMORBIDITY, SECONDARY SURGERIES AND POTENTIALLY OTHER, POORLY UNDERSTOOD INTERACTIONS: OFF LABEL USE OF INTRACAMERAL ALTEPLASE (ACTILYSE) (RTPA), MULTIFACTORIAL, HIGH PHOSPHATE CONTENT OPHTHALMIC VISCOELASTIC DEVICES , REPEATED EXPOSURE TO INTRACAMERAL AIR, RAISED INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE, EXCESSIVE POST-OPERATIVE INFLAMMATION, COMPLICATED, TRAUMATISED EYES, AS A RESULT OF DIRECT CONTACT BETWEEN THE IOL SURFACE AND THE EXOGENOUS GAS OR SUBSTANCE, A METABOLIC CHANGE IN THE ANTERIOR CHAMBER DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF EXOGENOUS GAS/SUBSTANCE IN THE EYE OR AN EXACERBATED INFLAMMATORY REACTION AFTER MULTIPLE SURGICAL PROCEDURES, TRAUMA OR REPEAT SURGERY INVOLVED IN RE-BUBBLING POTENTIALLY DISRUPTING THE BLOOD AQUEOUS BARRIER, INCREASING CONCENTRATION OF CALCIUM IONS. RAYNER'S RATE OF SECONDARY CALCIFICATION REMAINS EXTREMELY LOW. OUR INCIDENT RATE FOR THE PERIOD JANUARY 2016 - FEBRUARY 2022 IS (B)(4)%. ADDITIONALLY, THE RATE OF CONFIRMED OPACIFICATION CASES (WHERE WE HAVE PERFORMED SEM AND EDS ANALYSIS AND HAVE IDENTIFIED CALCIUM PHOSPHATE ON THE LENS) IS 0.0006%. THE PATIENT'S MEDICAL HISTORY, REPEAT OCULAR PROCEDURES WITH INSERTION OF SF6 GAS ARE CONTRIBUTORY/CAUSATIVE FACTORS TO THE ONSET OF POST-OPERATIVE OPACIFICATION IN THIS CASE. ON (B)(6) 2022, RAYNER INTRAOCULAR LENSES LIMITED RECEIVED NOTIFICATION FROM A HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL IN SOUTH AFRICA OF AN EVENT THAT OCCURRED FOLLOWING IMPLANTATION OF A SUPERFLEX ASPHERIC 920H IOL. THE EVENT DESCRIPTION PROVIDED STATES THAT 5 YEARS AND 10 MONTHS POST CATARACT SURGERY AND IOL IMPLANTATION OPACIFICATION OF THE IOL WAS OBSERVED.

THE EVENT DESCRIPTION PROVIDED STATES THAT OPACIFICATION OF THE IOL WAS OBSERVED 1 YEAR AND 5 MONTHS FOLLOWING IOL IMPLANTATION. THE REFERENCE (B)(4) HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THIS CASE BY RAYNER. THE EVENT DESCRIPTION PROVIDED STATES THAT OPACIFICATION OF THE IOL WAS OBSERVED 1 YEAR AND 5 MONTHS POST IOL IMPLANTATION. THE PATIENT UNDERWENT CATARACT SURGERY AND IOL IMPLANTATION ON (B)(6) 2010. IOL IMPLANTATION WAS NOT COMBINED WITH ANY OTHER OCULAR PROCEDURE AND IS REPORTED TO HAVE BEEN PERFORMED WITHOUT COMPLICATION. THE PATIENT MEDICAL HISTORY RECEIVED IDENTIFIED THAT PRIOR TO CATARACT SURGERY AND IOL IMPLANTATION THE PATIENT HAD UNDERGONE A PENETRATING CORNEA TRANSPLANT IN THE SUBJECT EYE WITH PREVIOUS REJECTION REACTIONS OF THE GRAFT. THE PATIENT IS ALSO REPORTED TO HAVE BULLOUS KERATOPATHY. POST IOL IMPLANTATION, THE PATIENT REQUIRED SEVERAL OCULAR PROCEDURES; DESCEMET STRIPPING AUTOMATED ENDOTHELIAL KERATOPLASTY (DSAEK) ON (B)(6) 2010, RE-BUBBLING OF THE ANTERIOR CHAMBER WITH SF6 GAS ON (B)(6) 2010, REINSERTION OF SF6 GAS (ACEOLE) ON (B)(6) 2010, AND YAG CAPSULOTOMY ON (B)(6) 2011. OPACIFICATION WAS OBSERVED FOR THE FIRST TIME 1 YEAR AND 5 MONTHS FOLLOWING IOL IMPLANTATION AND 10 MONTHS FOLLOWING INSERTION OF SF6 GAS INTO THE ANTERIOR CHAMBER. OPACIFICATION LED TO A DECREASE IN THE PATIENT VISUAL ACUITY NECESSITATING LENS EXPLANTATION. LENS EXPLANTATION AND EXCHANGE WAS PERFORMED ON (B)(6) 2012. RAYNER IFUS CONTRAINDICATE "ACTIVE OCULAR DISEASES (CHRONIC SEVERE UVEITIS, PROLIFERATIVE DIABETIC RETINOPATHY, CHRONIC GLAUCOMA NOT RESPONSIVE TO MEDICATION") AND "CORNEAL DECOMPENSATION OR ENDOTHELIAL INSUFFICIENCY". PRIMARY CALCIFICATION IS INHERENT. IT IS DUE TO PARTICULAR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES OR PACKAGING INTERACTIONS. AN EXAMINATION OF THE LITERATURE SHOWS THAT SOME MANUFACTURERS HAVE HAD KNOWN CASES OF PRIMARY CALCIFICATION DUE TO AN INTERACTION WITH SILICONE IN THE PACKAGING - AND MORE RECENTLY, DUE TO PHOSPHATE REMNANTS (ORIGINATING FROM A DETERGENT) FOUND IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. RAYNER HAS MADE NO MATERIAL PROCESSING OR PACKAGING CHANGES THAT MAY HAVE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED OUR IOLS; WE HAVE NEVER HAD A CONFIRMED CASE OF PRIMARY CALCIFICATION RELATING TO A RAYNER IOL. SECONDARY CALCIFICATION AFFECTS MANY MANUFACTURERS AND IS A PHENOMENON THAT IS NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD; IT IS KNOWN THAT IT STEMS FROM CHANGES IN THE EYE'S ENVIRONMENT DUE TO PATIENT COMORBIDITY, SECONDARY SURGERIES AND POTENTIALLY OTHER, POORLY UNDERSTOOD INTERACTIONS: OFF LABEL USE OF INTRACAMERAL ALTEPLASE (ACTILYSE) (RTPA), MULTIFACTORIAL, HIGH PHOSPHATE CONTENT OPHTHALMIC VISCOELASTIC DEVICES , REPEATED EXPOSURE TO INTRACAMERAL AIR, RAISED INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE, EXCESSIVE POST-OPERATIVE INFLAMMATION, COMPLICATED, TRAUMATISED EYES, AS A RESULT OF DIRECT CONTACT BETWEEN THE IOL SURFACE AND THE EXOGENOUS GAS OR SUBSTANCE, A METABOLIC CHANGE IN THE ANTERIOR CHAMBER DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF EXOGENOUS GAS/SUBSTANCE IN THE EYE OR AN EXACERBATED INFLAMMATORY REACTION AFTER MULTIPLE SURGICAL PROCEDURES, TRAUMA OR REPEAT SURGERY INVOLVED IN RE-BUBBLING POTENTIALLY DISRUPTING THE BLOOD AQUEOUS BARRIER, INCREASING CONCENTRATION OF CALCIUM IONS. RAYNER'S RATE OF SECONDARY CALCIFICATION REMAINS EXTREMELY LOW. (B)(4). THE PATIENT'S MEDICAL HISTORY, REPEAT OCULAR PROCEDURES WITH INSERTION OF SF6 GAS ARE CONTRIBUTORY/CAUSATIVE FACTORS TO THE ONSET OF POST-OPERATIVE OPACIFICATION IN THIS CASE.

A FACILITY REPRESENTATIVE REPORTED THAT FOLLOWING AN INTRAOCULAR LENS (IOL) IMPLANT PROCEDURE, THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED DECREASED VISION. THE IOL WAS EXCHANGED FOR ANOTHER LENS MODEL 15 DAYS FOLLOWING THE INITIAL IMPLANT PROCEDURE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AS BEEN RECEIVED AND STATED THAT IN SURGEON'S OPINION PRODUCT DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE EVENT DUE TO DISLOCATED IMPLANT DUE TO POSTERIOR CAPSULAR RENT. THE PATIENT WAS NOT HOSPITALIZED FOR THE EVENT.
THE PRODUCT WAS NOT RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS. VIDEO WAS PROVIDED AND THE REPORTED COMPLAINT WAS OBSERVED. VIDEO PROVIDED SHOWS IOL IMPLANTATION WITH COM HANDPIECE AND CARTRIDGE. THE LENS PREPARATION AND OVD FILL IS NOT PROVIDED. THE NOZZLE COMES IN THE PICTURE AT THE PAUSE LOCATION. THE LENS APPEARS TO BE IN THE CORRECT POSITION FOR IMPLANTATION. THE PLUNGER IS AT THE TRAILING OPTIC EDGE AND BOTH HAPTICS ARE FOLDED ONTO THE OPTIC. AS THE LENS IS ADVANCED, THE PLUNGER IS SEEN BEING SLIGHTLY PUSHED INTO THE FOLDED LENS. THIS MAY HAPPEN IF INADEQUATE VISCOELASTIC IS PLACED IN THE DEVICE THIS WILL CAUSE INADEQUATE COVERAGE OF THE LENS FOLD PATH WHICH MAY CAUSE THE LENS TO ADVANCE INCORRECTLY CAUSING FRICTION. THE LENS IS IMPLANTED AND IS BEING POSITIONED WITH AN ADDITIONAL INSTRUMENTATION. AROUND 5 O'CLOCK POSITION A LARGE CRACKS/ MARKS ARE VISIBLE AT THE OPTIC EDGE. A SMALLER CRACK IS VISIBLE ABOVE THE GUSSET AREA. THE PRODUCT INVESTIGATION COULD NOT IDENTIFY THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE REPORTED COMPLAINT "OPTIC WAS VISUALLY SCRATCHED". FROM THE VIDEO IT APPEARS THAT THE PLUNGER MAY HAVE BEEN ADVANCED SLIGHTLY OVER THE LENS. THIS MAY HAPPEN IF INADEQUATE VISCOELASTIC IS PLACED IN THE DEVICE THIS WILL CAUSE INADEQUATE COVERAGE OF THE LENS FOLD PATH WHICH MAY CAUSE THE LENS TO ADVANCE INCORRECTLY CAUSING FRICTION. LENS DAMAGE MAY OCCUR: ¿ DUE TO THE USE OF A NON-QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC. LENS DELIVERY PERFORMANCE MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED WHEN USING OTHER NON-QUALIFIED VISCOELASTICS LEADING TO UNDERFILL, OVERFILL, MISFOLDING , DELIVERY ISSUES AND /OR DAMAGE. ¿ IF INADEQUATE VISCOELASTIC IS PLACED IN THE DEVICE THIS WILL CAUSE INADEQUATE COVERAGE OF THE LENS FOLD PATH WHICH MAY CAUSE THE LENS TO ADVANCE INCORRECTLY AND CAUSE DELIVERY ISSUES AND /OR DAMAGE. ¿ IF THE OPERATING ROOM TEMPERATURE IS TOO HIGH (> 23°C / 73° F) LENS FOLDING CONSISTENCY IS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED, THE LENS IS MORE ADHERENT AND THIS MAY INHIBIT LENS ADVANCEMENT AND CAUSE DELIVERY ISSUES AND / OR PRODUCT DAMAGE. ANY OF THE ABOVE LISTED CAUSES ALONE, OR IN COMBINATION, MAY CREATE THE REPORTED EVENT. IN ADDITION TO THIS, ALL IOLS ARE 100% COSMETICALLY INSPECTED AS PER APPROVED MANUFACTURING PROCEDURES AND THE OBSERVED LENS DAMAGE WOULD NOT MEET OUR CURRENT RELEASE CRITERIA. BASED ON THESE INVESTIGATION FINDINGS, WE ARE UNABLE TO VERIFY IF THE IOL CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT. BASED ON THE RESULTS FROM THE PRODUCT HISTORY RECORD, THE PRODUCTS MET RELEASE CRITERIA. THERE ARE NO OTHER COMPLAINTS FOR THE REPORTED LOT. THE MANUFACTURER INTERNAL REFERENCE NUMBER IS: (B)(4).

THROUGH FOLLOW-UP WITH A REPRESENTATIVE AT THE SURGICAL CENTER, IT WAS LEARNED THAT THE PT HAD A PLANNED KAHOOK DUAL BLADE (KDB) GONIOTOMY DURING THE IMPLANT SURGERY TO RELIEVE EYE PRESSURE, WHICH IS WHY THE SUTURE WAS PERFORMED. THE PT'S PUPIL WAS ROUND AND IOL WAS STABLE AND CENTERED. THERE WAS NO ISSUE WITH THE LENS. THROUGH FOLLOW-UP WITH THE SURGEON, IT WAS LEARNED THAT THE PT HAS PRE-EXISTING GLAUCOMA WHICH IS WHY THE PATIENT HAD A PLANNED COMBO PROCEDURE OF CATARACT SURGERY AND KDB GONIOTOMY. THE SUTURE WAS UNPLANNED, AS THE PT¿S WOUND WAS NOT SEALING APPROPRIATELY SO THE SUTURE WAS PLACED. THE PT IS HIGHLY MYOPIC WITH VERY LONG EYES. THE SURGEON REPORTED THAT THE PT IS EXPERIENCING SYMPTOMATIC POSITIVE DYSPHOTOPSIA AND IT IS NOT DUE TO ANY DEFECT WITH THE IOL. THE PT HAS A "LITTLE RESIDUAL ASTIGMATISM" BUT HAS 20/20 VISUAL ACUITY WITH A TORIC CONTACT LENS. THE SURGEON REPORTED THAT WITH THE GONIOTOMY IT IS POSSIBLE TO HAVE SOME BLOOD IN ANTERIOR CHAMBER, BUT WAS UNABLE TO CONFIRM THE PATIENT'S ISSUE. THE ISSUE RESOLVED WITHOUT MEDICAL OR SURGICAL INTERVENTION AND THE SURGEON CONFIRMED IT WAS NOT ATTRIBUTED TO THE IMPLANTED IOL. THE SURGEON WAS UNABLE TO CONFIRM THE REPORTED ¿AIR POCKETS¿ BEHIND THE EYE. THERE WERE NO SURGICAL COMPLICATIONS, NO PATIENT INJURY, AND NO ADDITIONAL SURGICAL OR MEDICAL INTERVENTION REQUIRED. THERE HAVE BEEN NO SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURES. NO SURGICAL INTERVENTION IS CURRENTLY PLANNED FOR THE OD. NO FURTHER INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED.

THE REFERENCE (B)(4) HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THIS CASE BY RAYNER. THE EVENT DESCRIPTION PROVIDED STATES THAT OPACIFICATION WAS OBSERVED FOR THE FIRST TIME 6 YEARS AND 10 MONTHS FOLLOWING IOL IMPLANTATION AND 8 MONTHS FOLLOWING INSERTION OF SF6 GAS INTO THE ANTERIOR CHAMBER. THE PATIENT UNDERWENT CATARACT SURGERY AND IOL IMPLANTATION OF (B)(6) 2007. IOL IMPLANTATION WAS NOT COMBINED WITH ANY OTHER OCULAR PROCEDURE AND WAS REPORTED TO HAVE BEEN PERFORMED WITHOUT COMPLICATION. THE PATIENT MEDICAL HISTORY RECEIVED IDENTIFIES THAT THE PATIENT HAS KERATOCONUS, BULLOUS KERATOPATHY AND THAT THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY UNDERGONE A PENETRATING CORNEA TRANSPLANT IN THE SUBJECT EYE. POST IOL IMPLANTATION, THE PATIENT REQUIRED SEVERAL OCULAR PROCEDURES; YAG CAPSULOTOMY ON (B)(6) 2012, DESCEMET STRIPPING AUTOMATED ENDOTHELIAL KERATOPLASTY (DSAEK) ON (B)(6) 2013, RE-BUBBLING OF THE ANTERIOR CHAMBER WITH SF6 GAS ON (B)(6) 2013 AND REINSERTION OF SF6 GAS ON (B)(6) 2013. OPACIFICATION LED TO A DECREASE IN THE PATIENT VISUAL ACUITY NECESSITATING LENS EXPLANTATION. LENS EXPLANTATION AND EXCHANGE WAS PERFORMED ON (B)(6) 2014. THE IOL IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR RETURN TO RAYNER. THE DEVICE HAS BEEN DISCARDED BY THE HEALTHCARE FACILITY. RAYNER IFUS CONTRAINDICATE "ACTIVE OCULAR DISEASES (CHRONIC SEVERE UVEITIS, PROLIFERATIVE DIABETIC RETINOPATHY, CHRONIC GLAUCOMA NOT RESPONSIVE TO MEDICATION") AND "CORNEAL DECOMPENSATION OR ENDOTHELIAL INSUFFICIENCY". PRIMARY CALCIFICATION IS INHERENT. IT IS DUE TO PARTICULAR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES OR PACKAGING INTERACTIONS. AN EXAMINATION OF THE LITERATURE SHOWS THAT SOME MANUFACTURERS HAVE HAD KNOWN CASES OF PRIMARY CALCIFICATION DUE TO AN INTERACTION WITH SILICONE IN THE PACKAGING - AND MORE RECENTLY, DUE TO PHOSPHATE REMNANTS (ORIGINATING FROM A DETERGENT) FOUND IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. RAYNER HAS MADE NO MATERIAL PROCESSING OR PACKAGING CHANGES THAT MAY HAVE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED OUR IOLS; WE HAVE NEVER HAD A CONFIRMED CASE OF PRIMARY CALCIFICATION RELATING TO A RAYNER IOL. SECONDARY CALCIFICATION AFFECTS MANY MANUFACTURERS AND IS A PHENOMENON THAT IS NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD; IT IS KNOWN THAT IT STEMS FROM CHANGES IN THE EYE'S ENVIRONMENT DUE TO PATIENT COMORBIDITY, SECONDARY SURGERIES AND POTENTIALLY OTHER, POORLY UNDERSTOOD INTERACTIONS: OFF LABEL USE OF INTRACAMERAL ALTEPLASE (ACTILYSE) (RTPA), MULTIFACTORIAL, HIGH PHOSPHATE CONTENT OPHTHALMIC VISCOELASTIC DEVICES , REPEATED EXPOSURE TO INTRACAMERAL AIR, RAISED INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE, EXCESSIVE POST-OPERATIVE INFLAMMATION, COMPLICATED, TRAUMATISED EYES, AS A RESULT OF DIRECT CONTACT BETWEEN THE IOL SURFACE AND THE EXOGENOUS GAS OR SUBSTANCE, A METABOLIC CHANGE IN THE ANTERIOR CHAMBER DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF EXOGENOUS GAS/SUBSTANCE IN THE EYE OR AN EXACERBATED INFLAMMATORY REACTION AFTER MULTIPLE SURGICAL PROCEDURES, TRAUMA OR REPEAT SURGERY INVOLVED IN RE-BUBBLING POTENTIALLY DISRUPTING THE BLOOD AQUEOUS BARRIER, INCREASING CONCENTRATION OF CALCIUM IONS. RAYNER'S RATE OF SECONDARY CALCIFICATION REMAINS EXTREMELY LOW. (B)(4). THE PATIENT'S MEDICAL HISTORY, REPEAT OCULAR PROCEDURES WITH INSERTION OF SF6 GAS ARE CONTRIBUTORY/CAUSATIVE FACTORS TO THE ONSET OF POST-OPERATIVE OPACIFICATION IN THIS CASE. ON 2ND APRIL 2022, RAYNER INTRAOCULAR LENSES LIMITED RECEIVED NOTIFICATION FROM A SOUTH AFRICAN HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL OF AN EVENT THAT OCCURRED FOLLOWING IMPLANTATION OF A T-FLEX ASPHERIC 623T IOL. THE EVENT DESCRIPTION PROVIDED STATES THAT 6 YEARS AND 10 MONTHS FOLLOWING IOL IMPLANTATION OPACIFICATION OF THE IOL WAS OBSERVED.

A CONSUMER REPORTED THAT FOLLOWING AN INTRAOCULAR LENS (IOL) IMPLANT PROCEDURE, THE PATIENT HAD WORSEN VISION THAN BEFORE SURGERY. THE OPTOMETRIST HAD TOLD TO PATIENT TO CONTINUE TO TAKE STEROID DROPS MONTHS AFTER THE SURGERY. NO MORE INFORMATION AVAILABLE. A SAMPLE DEVICE WAS NOT RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS. COMPLAINT HISTORY AND PRODUCT HISTORY RECORD COULD NOT BE REVIEWED BECAUSE THE REPORTING FACILITY DID NOT PROVIDE A VALID LOT NUMBER OR ANY IDENTIFICATION TRACEABLE TO THE MANUFACTURING DOCUMENTATION. ROOT CAUSE HAS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED. THE MANUFACTURER INTERNAL REFERENCE NUMBER IS:(B)(4).
A SURGEON REPORTED THAT, DURING INTRAOCULAR LENS (IOL) IMPLANT PROCEDURE, THE IOL PLUNGE MADE THE IOL FOLD INCORRECTLY. THE SURGERY WAS COMPLETED BY THE HELP WITH ANOTHER INSTRUMENT TO MAKE IOL UNFOLD AND BE PLACED CORRECTLY IN CAPSULE . ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS REQUESTED. THE DEVICE WITH THE LENS WAS RETURNED LOOSE IN THE OPENED CARTON. THE LENS STOP AND PLUNGER LOCK WERE REMOVED. THE PLUNGER WAS ORIENTED CORRECTLY. VISCOELASTIC WAS OBSERVED IN THE DEVICE. THE PLUNGER WAS ADVANCED TO NEAR THE FILL LINE AND HAS OVERRODE THE LENS. THE LENS WAS SLIGHTLY ADVANCED INSIDE THE LOADING AREA. THE TRAILING HAPTIC WAS FOLDED ONTO THE ANTERIOR OPTIC SURFACE ALONG THE LEFT SIDE OF THE PLUNGER. THE LEADING HAPTIC WAS AHEAD OF THE OPTIC. PRODUCT HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED AND DOCUMENTATION INDICATED THE PRODUCT MET RELEASE CRITERIA. A QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC WAS INDICATED. THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE REPORTED COMPLAINT CANNOT BE DETERMINED. PLUNGER OVERRIDE WAS OBSERVED. THE PLUNGER OVERRIDE WAS MOST LIKELY INTERPRETED AS THE COMPLAINT. THE LENS WAS STILL INSIDE THE LENS LOADING AREA. A QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC WAS INDICATED. PLUNGER OVERRIDE MAY OCCUR: DUE TO RAPID ADVANCEMENT FASTER THAN THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU) RECOMMEND RATE. IF INADEQUATE VISCOELASTIC IS PLACED IN THE DEVICE THIS WILL CAUSE INADEQUATE COVERAGE OF THE LENS FOLD PATH WHICH MAY CAUSE THE LENS TO ADVANCE INCORRECTLY OR BECOME ¿STUCK¿ IN THE DEVICE ALLOWING THE PLUNGER TO OVERRIDE THE LENS. IF THE DEVICE IS OVERFILLED WITH VISCOELASTIC (OVD), THIS CAN PREVENT THE TRAILING HAPTIC FROM BEING PLACED PROPERLY OR MOVE THE LENS OUT OF POSITION RESULTING IN MISFOLDING. IF THE OPERATING ROOM TEMPERATURE IS TOO HIGH (> 23°C / 73° F) LENS FOLDING CONSISTENCY IS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED, THE LENS IS MORE ADHERENT AND THIS MAY INHIBIT LENS ADVANCEMENT. ANY OF THE ABOVE LISTED CAUSES ALONE, OR IN COMBINATION, MAY CREATE THE REPORTED EVENT. THERE HAVE BEEN NO OTHER COMPLAINTS REPORTED IN THE LOT NUMBER. THE MANUFACTURER INTERNAL REFERENCE NUMBER IS: (B)(4).

A NEW IOL (SAME MODEL AND DIOPTER) WAS IMPLANTED WITHOUT INCIDENT AND THE PATIENT HAD A SUCCESSFUL SURGERY OUTCOME. THERE WAS NO ADDITIONAL SURGICAL OR MEDICAL INTERVENTION REQUIRED AND NO PATIENT INJURY. NO FURTHER INFORMATION WAS RECEIVED.
DAMAGED HAPTIC AFTER IMPLANTATION. THE LEADING HAPTIC WAS DETACHED FROM THE OPTIC. THE IOL WAS EXPLANTED FROM THE EYE. PATIENT IMPACT: INTRA-OPERATIVE EXPLANTATION. THIS INITIAL AND FINAL EMDR IS BEING SUBMITTED TO FDA FOR A REPORTABLE EVENT THAT OCCURRED OUTSIDE THE USA. HAPTIC DAMAGE IS INDICATED AS A POTENTIAL MALFUNCTION RELATED TO THE IOL, AS COVERED UNDER THE WARNINGS SECTION OF THE PRODUCT'S INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU).PORTIONS OF THE PRODUCT WERE RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER. THE INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED, WITH THE METHODS AND RESULTS AS NOTED BELOW. INJECTOR AND PART OF IOL WERE AVAILABLE FOR INVESTIGATION. APPEARANCE CHECK RESULT WAS CONSISTENT TO REPORTED INFORMATION. NO ABNORMALITIES WERE FOUND IN PRODUCTION AND INSPECTION RECORDS OF THE PRODUCT. (SERIAL NO.: (B)(4); MODEL: PY-60AD). WE ALSO CONFIRMED THERE WERE NOT ANY ABNORMALITIES ON THE LOOP PULL STRENGTH TEST REPORT FOR THE MATERIAL LOT. (MATERIAL LOT.: SYSB-60-01). THE DYE TEST RESULT SHOWED THE INJECTOR TIP WAS PROPERLY COATED. PROPER COATING ALLOWS THE LENS TO ADVANCE. WE COULD RELEASE A RE-INSTALLED IOL FROM THE RETURNED INJECTOR WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS. BASED ON THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION AND OUR INVESTIGATION, WE BELIEVE THIS EVENT WAS NOT CAUSED BY OUR PRODUCT QUALITY. A REVIEW OF THE MOST RECENT COMPLAINT TRENDING DATA INDICATES THAT NO SIGNIFICANT TRENDS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AT THIS TIME AND NO CAPA IS REQUIRED AS PART OF THE PRODUCT EVALUATION.

A NON HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL REPORTED DURING AN INTRAOCULAR LENS IMPLANT PROCEDURE, THE BROKEN LENS STUCK IN SYRINGE. PATIENT CONTACT IS UNSURE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN REQUESTED. THE DEVICE WITH THE LENS WAS RETURNED LOOSE IN THE OPENED CARTON. THE PLUNGER LOCK AND LENS STOP HAVE BEEN REMOVED. THE PLUNGER WAS ORIENTED CORRECTLY. VISCOELASTIC WAS OBSERVED IN THE DEVICE. THE PLUNGER HAS ADVANCED TO MID-NOZZLE AND HAS UNDER RODE THE LENS. THE LENS WAS LOCATED WITHIN THE LOADING AREA ON TOP OF THE PLUNGER. THE LEADING HAPTIC WAS POSITIONED ON TOP OF THE PLUNGER AHEAD OF THE OPTIC. THE TRAILING HAPTIC WAS MISFOLDED COMPLETELY UNDERNEATH THE OPTIC ALONG THE LEFT SIDE OF THE PLUNGER. THE LENS WAS NOT BROKEN. THE MISFOLDED TRAILING HAPTIC DUE TO THE PLUNGER UNDERRIDE WAS MOST LIKELY INTERPRETED AS THE REPORTED COMPLAINT. PRODUCT HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED AND DOCUMENTATION INDICATED THE PRODUCT MET RELEASE CRITERIA. VISCOELASTIC INFORMATION WAS NOT PROVIDED. IT IS UNKNOWN IF A QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC WAS USED. THERE HAVE BEEN ONE OTHER COMPLAINT FOR THE LOT. THE ROOT CAUSE CANNOT BE DETERMINED FOR THE REPORTED COMPLAINT. THE LENS WAS NOT BROKEN; HOWEVER, A MISFOLDED HAPTIC DUE TO PLUNGER UNDERRIDE WAS OBSERVED. THE APPEARANCE OF THE MISFOLDED HAPTIC WAS MOST LIKELY INTERPRETED AS THE REPORTED COMPLAINT. IT IS UNKNOWN IF A QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC WAS USED. THE INSTRUCTION FOR USE (IFU) INSTRUCTS: DURING DEVICE PREPARATION AND IMPLANTATION OF THE COMPANY PRELOADED DELIVERY SYSTEM, AN COMPANY QUALIFIED OPHTHALMIC VISCOELASTIC DEVICE (OVD) SHOULD BE USED. THE USE OF AN UNQUALIFIED OVD MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE LENS AND POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS DURING THE DEVICE PREPARATION AND IMPLANTATION STEPS. PLUNGER UNDERRIDE MAY OCCUR: DUE TO RAPID ADVANCEMENT FASTER THAN THE INSTRUCTION FOR USE (IFU) RECOMMEND RATE. DUE TO THE USE OF A NON-QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC. MATERIAL PROPERTIES OF NON-QUALIFIED OVDS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO UNDERFILL, OVERFILL, MISFOLDING OF THE HAPTICS, OR OTHER INCONSISTENT FOLDING OUTCOMES. IF INADEQUATE VISCOELASTIC IS PLACED IN THE DEVICE, THIS WILL CAUSE INADEQUATE COVERAGE OF THE LENS FOLD PATH WHICH MAY CAUSE THE LENS TO ADVANCE INCORRECTLY OR BECOME ¿STUCK¿ IN THE DEVICE ALLOWING THE PLUNGER TO UNDERRIDE THE LENS. IF THE DEVICE IS OVERFILLED WITH OVD, THIS CAN PREVENT THE TRAILING HAPTIC FROM BEING PLACED PROPERLY OR MOVE THE LENS OUT OF POSITION RESULTING IN MISFOLDING. IF THE OPERATING ROOM TEMPERATURE IS TOO HIGH (> 23°C/73° F) LENS FOLDING CONSISTENCY IS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED, THE LENS IS MORE ADHERENT AND THIS MAY INHIBIT LENS ADVANCEMENT. ANY OF THE ABOVE LISTED CAUSES ALONE, OR IN COMBINATION, MAY CREATE THE REPORTED EVENT. THE MANUFACTURER INTERNAL REFERENCE NUMBER IS: (B)(4).

THE REFERENCE (B)(4) HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THIS CASE BY RAYNER. THE PATIENT UNDERWENT IMPLANTATION OF THE C-FLEX 570C IOL IN THE RIGHT EYE ON (B)(6) 2017. POST-OPERATIVELY, THE PATIENT COMPLAINED OF LOW VISUAL ACUITY. IOL OPACIFICATION WAS OBSERVED FOR THE FIRST TIME ON (B)(6) 2020. THE PATIENT MEDICAL HISTORY RECEIVED IDENTIFIES THAT THE PATIENT HAS ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION. THE PATIENT HAS RECENTLY COMPLAINED OF FURTHER DECLINE IN THEIR VISUAL ACUITY AND THE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL HAS DECIDED TO EXPLANT THE LENS. EXPLANTATION IS SCHEDULED FOR (B)(6) 2022. RAYNER HAS REQUESTED THE RETURN OF THE EXPLANTED IOL FOR STRUCTURAL AND ULTRASTRUCTURAL ANALYSIS (SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY (SEM) AND ENERGY DISPERSIVE X-RAY FLUORESCENCE (EDX) SPECTROSCOPY). ANALYSIS WILL BE COMPLETED BY A THIRD-PARTY INDEPENDENT LABORATORY AND THE RESULTS WILL BE PROVIDED IN A FOLLOW-UP REPORT. PRIMARY CALCIFICATION IS INHERENT. IT IS DUE TO PARTICULAR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES OR PACKAGING INTERACTIONS. AN EXAMINATION OF THE LITERATURE SHOWS THAT SOME MANUFACTURERS HAVE HAD KNOWN CASES OF PRIMARY CALCIFICATION DUE TO AN INTERACTION WITH SILICONE IN THE PACKAGING - AND MORE RECENTLY, DUE TO PHOSPHATE REMNANTS (ORIGINATING FROM A DETERGENT) FOUND IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. RAYNER HAS MADE NO MATERIAL PROCESSING OR PACKAGING CHANGES THAT MAY HAVE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED OUR IOLS; WE HAVE NEVER HAD A CONFIRMED CASE OF PRIMARY CALCIFICATION RELATING TO A RAYNER IOL. SECONDARY CALCIFICATION AFFECTS MANY MANUFACTURERS AND IS A PHENOMENON THAT IS NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD; IT IS KNOWN THAT IT STEMSFROM CHANGES IN THE EYE'S ENVIRONMENT DUE TO PATIENT COMORBIDITY, SECONDARY SURGERIES AND POTENTIALLY OTHER, POORLY UNDERSTOOD INTERACTIONS: OFF LABEL USE OF INTRACAMERAL ALTEPLASE (ACTILYSE) (RTPA), MULTIFACTORIAL, HIGH PHOSPHATE CONTENT OPHTHALMIC VISCOELASTIC DEVICES , REPEATED EXPOSURE TO INTRACAMERAL AIR, RAISED INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE, EXCESSIVE POST-OPERATIVE INFLAMMATION, COMPLICATED, TRAUMATISED EYES, AS A RESULT OF DIRECT CONTACT BETWEEN THE IOL SURFACE AND THE EXOGENOUS GAS OR SUBSTANCE, A METABOLIC CHANGE IN THE ANTERIOR CHAMBER DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF EXOGENOUS GAS/SUBSTANCE IN THE EYE OR AN EXACERBATED INFLAMMATORY REACTION AFTER MULTIPLE SURGICAL PROCEDURES, TRAUMA OR REPEAT SURGERY INVOLVED IN RE-BUBBLING POTENTIALLY DISRUPTING THE BLOOD AQUEOUS BARRIER, INCREASING CONCENTRATION OF CALCIUM IONS. ON 18TH APRIL 2022, RAYNER INTRAOCULAR LENSES LIMITED RECEIVED NOTIFICATION FROM ITS BRAZIIAN DISTRIBUTOR OF AN EVENT THAT OCCURRED FOLLOWING IMPLANTATION OF A C-FLEX 570C IOL. THE EVENT DESCRIPTION PROVIDED STATES THAT POST-OPERATIVELY THE PATIENT COMPLAINED OF LOW VISUAL ACUITY AND EXAMINATION OF THE RIGHT EYE IDENTIFIED OPACIFICATION OF THE IOL.

CASE REFERENCE NUMBER (B)(4) IS A LITERATURE REPORT IDENTIFIED ON 06-APR-2022 DURING LITERATURE SEARCH. THIS CASE REFERS TO A 43-YEARS-OLD CAUCASIAN FEMALE PATIENT. THIS CASE WAS IDENTIFIED FROM THE LITERATURE ARTICLE DAVIDOVA P, MULLER M, WENNER Y, KONIG C, KENIKSTUL N, KOHNEN T. OPHTHALMIC ARTERY OCCLUSION AFTER GLABELLAR HYALURONIC ACID FILLER INJECTION. AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY CASE REPORTS 2022;26:101407. ABSTRACT: A HEALTHY, 43-YEAR-OLD WOMAN UNDERWENT HER FIRST HYALURONIC ACID INJECTION IN THE GLABELLA AND WENT BLIND ON HER LEFT EYE IMMEDIATELY THEREAFTER. THE MASSAGING OF THE INJECTION AREA AND OBSERVATION WERE PERFORMED, BEFORE SHE PRESENTED WITH SWELLING OF THE LEFT FOREHEAD AND UPPER LID, PTOSIS, COMPLETE OPHTHALMOPLEGIA AND BLINDNESS IN OUR HOSPITAL. IMMEDIATE MASSAGING OF THE GLOBE AND SYSTEMIC THERAPY INCLUDING ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID, TINZAPARIN SODIUM AND CORTISONE WAS INITIATED AND HYALURONIDASE INJECTIONS IN THE INJECTION AREA WERE PERFORMED. IN THE FURTHER COURSE, THE PATIENT DEVELOPED NECROTIC AND HEMORRHAGIC SKIN AND MUCOSAL LESIONS, LAGOPHTHALMOS, ANTERIOR AND POSTERIOR SEGMENT ISCHEMIA AND GLOBE HYPOTONIA WITH CONSECUTIVE GLOBE DEFORMATION. IN THE FOLLOW-UP OF 2.5 MONTHS, LID SWELLING, LAGOPHTHALMOS AND PTOSIS RESOLVED AND KERATOPATHY IMPROVED BUT BLINDNESS, SKIN LESIONS AND STRABISMUS WITH REDUCED EYE MOTILITY WERE STILL PRESENT AND MADAROSIS AND EARLY ENOPHTHALMOS WERE DETECTED. THIS CASE REPORT ILLUSTRATES FATAL COMPLICATIONS, THEIR COURSE, PATHOMECHANISM, MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME AFTER HYALURONIC ACID FILLER INJECTION IN THE GLABELLA IN A HEALTHY WOMAN. CASE REPORT: A 43-YEAR-OLD CAUCASIAN FEMALE HEALTHY PATIENT UNDERWENT GLABELLAR INJECTION OF 0.7 ML HYALURONIC ACID/ LIDOCAINE (RESTYLANE) BY A NONMEDICAL PRACTITIONER. IT WAS THE PATIENT'S FIRST FILLER INJECTION, HER FORMER VISUAL ACUITY WAS 20/20 ON BOTH EYES AND NO OTHER DISEASES, INCLUDING OF THE EYES, WERE PRESENT BEFORE THE PROCEDURE. ACCORDING TO THE PATIENT, THE VISUAL FIELD OF HER LEFT EYE ALREADY DARKENED DURING THE PROCEDURE AND MASSAGING OF THE INJECTION AREA WITH OBSERVATION WAS PERFORMED, BEFORE SHE PRESENTED TO OUR HOSPITAL 1 H LATER. ONE HOUR AFTER THE HYALURONIC ACID INJECTION, THE PATIENT WAS TREATED WITH ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID 100 MG (S.I.D, PER ORAL), TINZAPARIN SODIUM 4.500 IE (S.I.D, SUBCUTANEOUS), METHYLPREDNISOLONE 100 MG (S.I.D, INTRAVENOUS FOR THREE DAYS), THEN PREDNISONE 90 MG PER ORAL, PANTOPRAZOLE 40 MG (S.I.D, PER OS, DURING STEROID MEDICATION). SWELLING OF THE LEFT FOREHEAD AND UPPER LID, PTOSIS AND COMPLETE OPHTHALMOPLEGIA WERE DETECTABLE. THE LEFT EYE HAD NO LIGHT PERCEPTION, THE INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE WAS NORMAL, THE LEFT PUPIL BARELY REACTED TO LIGHT AND SHOWED A RELATIVE AFFERENT PUPILLARY DEFECT. THE ANTERIOR SEGMENT DID NOT SHOW FURTHER PATHOLOGICAL FINDINGS. IN THE FUNDOSCOPY, THE OPTIC DISC PRESENTED WITH SHARP MARGINS, THE ARTERIES WERE THINNED, CHERRY RED SPOT AND RETINAL WHITENING WERE DOCUMENTED. IMMEDIATE MASSAGING OF THE GLOBE WAS ATTEMPTED AND FURTHER NEUROLOGICAL DIAGNOSTIC, INCLUDING NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING, WAS PERFORMED. BESIDES THE OPHTHALMIC PATHOLOGIES, THE NEUROLOGICAL CLINICAL FINDINGS WERE NORMAL AND IN THE MEDICAL IMAGING AN ISCHEMIC OPTIC NEUROPATHY WAS SUSPECTED. THERAPY WITH ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID, TINZAPARIN SODIUM, METHYLPREDNISOLONE, PANTOPRAZOLE, PAIN MANAGEMENT AND ANTISEPTIC COMPRESSES FOR THE FOREHEAD WAS INITIATED. THE DERMATOLOGISTS PERFORMED THREE HYALURONIDASE INJECTIONS IN THE INJECTION AREA. TWO DAYS AFTER THE GLABELLAR HYALURONIC ACID INJECTION, THE PERIOCULAR COMPLICATIONS WERE STILL MANIFEST WITH HEMORRHAGIC CHANGES ON THE UPPER LID. THERE WAS SWELLING, REDNESS AND SURFACE IRREGULARITIES ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE FOREHEAD, NOSE AND LEFT UPPER LID AND DISTINCT PTOSIS. THE LEFT EYE WAS SLIGHTLY DEPRESSED WHILE THE RIGHT EYE WAS SLIGHTLY ELEVATED INDICATING OPHTHALMOPLEGIA. TWO DAYS AFTER THE HYALURONIC ACID INJECTION, DEXPANTHENOL 5% EYE OINTMENT (Q.I.D.) AND OFLOXACIN 3 MG/G EYE OINTMENT (Q.I.D) WERE ADDED TO THE PATIENT'S CORRECTIVE THERAPY. THE PATIENT ALSO DEVELOPED SKIN LESIONS ON THE NOSE BRIDGE, ANTERIOR SEGMENT ISCHEMIA AND GLOBE HYPOTONIA. THE CONJUNCTIVA WAS INJECTED, THE CORNEA HAD EROSION, EDEMA AND DESCEMET FOLDS, THE PUPIL WAS AVERAGE SIZED, OVALLY WARPED, SHOWING NO LIGHT REACTION. A PERFORATION WAS RULED OUT. IN THE NEXT TWO DAYS, THE SKIN ON THE FOREHEAD AND THE INNER THIRD OF THE UPPER LID SHOWED EARLY NECROTIC CHANGES, THE VERTICAL LID FISSURE WIDTH WAS 9 MM, LEVATOR FUNCTION 5 MM AND A LAGOPHTHALMOS OF 3 MM WAS VISIBLE. EXOPHTHALMOMETRY WAS SYMMETRICAL AND EYE MOVEMENT COULD BE ACHIEVED APPROXIMATELY 5 DEGREE DOWNWARDS. THE CONJUNCTIVA SHOWED CHEMOSIS, KERATOPATHY WORSENED AND ANTERIOR CHAMBER FLATTENED TO MID DEPTH. A SONOGRAPHY REVEALED GLOBE DEFORMATION AND SWELLING OF THE CHOROIDEA. DUE TO THE STRONG SUSPICION OF AN OPHTHALMIC ARTERY OCCLUSION THE OTOLARYNGOLOGISTS WERE INVOLVED IN THIS CASE AND FOUND NECROTIC MUCOSAL TISSUE AT THE TOP OF THE LEFT MIDDLE NASAL CONCHA. THE CRANIAL NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING WAS REPEATED, REVEALING A COLLAPSED GLOBE AND EDEMATOUS LEFT OPTIC NERVE WITH DIFFUSION RESTRICTION. IN THE ANGIOGRAPHY, AN OPHTHALMIC ARTERY OCCLUSION COULD NOT BE CONFIRMED OR RULED OUT WITH CERTAINTY. FOUR DAYS AFTER THE HYALURONIC ACID INJECTION, THE PATIENT RECEIVED AN INCREASED DOSE OF DEXPANTHENOL 5% EYE OINTMENT EVERY 2 HOUR, AND MOISTURE CHAMBER (DURING LAGOPHTHALMOS), CLINDAMYCIN 300 MG (Q.I.D, PER OS, PRESCRIBED BY DERMATOLOGISTS), NASAL SPRAY CONTAINING SEA WATER AND DEXPANTHENOL WERE ADDED TO THE PATIENT'S CORRECTIVE THERAPY. THE FOLLOWING 4 DAYS (DAY 6 AFTER HYALURONIC ACID INJECTION), PREDNISOLONE 10 MG/ML EYE DROPS (T.I.D) AND ATROPINE 0.5% EYE DROPS (B.I.D) WERE ADDED AND PREDNISONE WAS REDUCED TO 60 MG (S.I.D, PER OS). TEN DAYS AFTER THE INJECTION COMPLETE LID CLOSURE COULD BE ACHIEVED, DEPRESSION, ELEVATION AND ABDUCTION IMPROVED SLIGHTLY, CORNEAL EROSION DECREASED, NO IRIDAL ISCHEMIC SIGNS WERE DETECTED, THE LENS HAD LITTLE LENTODONESIS AND THE SONOGRAPHIC FINDINGS WERE CONSTANT. TWO AND A HALF WEEKS AFTER THE HYALURONIC ACID INJECTION, LID SWELLING AND PTOSIS RESOLVED COMPLETELY, SHOWING A SYMMETRICAL LID FISSURE WIDTH OF 10 MM AND NORMAL LEVATOR FUNCTION. AMAUROSIS AND SEVERE GLOBE HYPOTONIA WERE STILL MANIFEST. THE CONJUNCTIVA WAS SPARSELY INJECTED, THE CORNEA WAS CLEAR, STIPPLED, WITHOUT CORNEAL EROSION. COMPARED TO THE FORMER MEDICAL FINDINGS, THE ANTERIOR CHAMBER DEEPENED. THE OPTIC NERVE WAS PALE WITH INDISTINCT MARGINS, THE RETINAL ARTERIES WERE VERY THIN AND THE RETINA WAS ISCHEMIC AND EDEMATOUS. NO CHERRY RED SPOT WAS VISIBLE AND, IN THE SONOGRAPHY, THE GLOBE WAS STILL DEFORMED. AT DAY TEN, THE PATIENT'S CORRECTIVE TREATMENT WITH DEXPANTHENOL 5% EYE OINTMENT WAS REDUCED TO 6 TIMES DAILY, PREDNISOLONE 10 MG/ML EYE DROPS REDUCED (B.I.D), ATROPINE 0.5% EYE DROPS REDUCED (S.I.D) AND PREDNISONE REDUCED TO 50 MG (S.I.D, PER OS). THE PREDNISONE DOSE WAS FURTHER REDUCED OF 10 MG EVERY THREE DAYS, REMAINING ON 10 MG) AND CLINDAMYCIN 300 MG WAS DISCONTINUED. TWO AND A HALF WEEK AFTER THE INJECTION, THE PATIENT'S OFLOXACIN 3 MG/G EYE OINTMENT USAGE WAS REDUCED (T.I.D) AND TINZAPARIN SODIUM 4.500 IE WAS DISCONTINUED. A FURTHER CONTROL EXAMINATION AFTER 6 WEEKS REVEALED REDNESS AND SURFACE IRREGULARITY ON THE FOREHEAD AND MADAROSIS ON THE INNER THIRD OF THE UPPER LID. ABDUCTION OF 25 DEGREE, COMPLETE ELEVATION, DEPRESSION OF 15 DEGREE AND TERMINALLY RESTRICTED ADDUCTION WITH STRABISMUS SHOWING ESOTROPIA AND HYPERTROPIA WAS VISIBLE. IN THE EXOPHTHALMOMETRY A 2 MM MORE POSTERIOR LOCATION OF THE AFFECTED EYE WAS DETECTED. THE VISUAL ACUITY KEPT UNCHANGED, THE GLOBE STARTED TO BUILD UP INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE, THE ANTERIOR CHAMBER FURTHER DEEPENED, MILD HYPEREMIA OF THE IRIS WAS DETECTABLE, THE PUPIL WAS STILL WARPED, DEVELOPING POSTERIOR SYNECHIAE IN THE INFERIOR NASAL QUADRANT. THE FUNDOSCOPY SHOWED PARTIALLY A SLIGHTLY INCREASED RETINAL VEIN CALIBER WITH TORTUOSITY AND VERY POOR TO NO RETINAL ARTERY FILLING WITH ISCHEMIC RETINAL AREAS. THE OCT REVEALED INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL RETINAL ATROPHY WITH LOSS OF RETINAL ARCHITECTURE. SIX WEEKS AFTER THE HYALURONIC ACID INJECTION, THE PREDNISONE DOSE WAS REDUCED TO 5 MG (S.I.D, PER OS, FOR TWO WEEKS, THEN DISCONTINUED) AND PREDNISOLONE 10 MG/ML EYE DROPS FREQUENCY REDUCED (S.I.D). THE PATIENT DISCONTINUED THE USE OF ATROPINE 0.5% EYE DROPS AND OFLOXACIN 3 MG/ ML EYE OINTMENT. TWO AND A HALF MONTH AFTER THE INCIDENT THE CLINICAL FINDINGS REMAINED CONSTANT. FUNDUS OF THE LEFT EYE SHOWED THE OPTIC NERVE WAS PALE WITH INDISTINCT MARGINS, VERY POOR TO NO RETINAL ARTERY FILLING, PARTIALLY SLIGHTLY INCREASED RETINAL VEIN CALIBER, NO CHERRY RED SPOT AND ISCHEMIC AREAS WERE DETECTABLE. AT THAT POINT, THE ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID 100 MG WAS DISCONTINUED AND PREDNISOLONE 10 MG/ML EYE DROPS REPLACED WITH DEXAMETHASONE 1 MG/ML EYE DROPS (S.I.D, WITHOUT PRESERVATIVES). DISCUSSION: IN OUR CASE, THE INJECTION OF 0.7 ML OF HYALURONIC ACID INTO THE SUPRATROCHLEAR ARTERY RESULTED IN OCCLUSION OF THE OPHTHALMIC ARTERY AND ITS BRANCHES. THE SKIN LESIONS WERE STILL PRESENT AFTER 2.5 MONTHS. IT WAS STATED THAT OCULAR MOVEMENT WAS WEAKENED IN EVERY DIRECTION, WHICH IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR PATIENT'S FINDINGS. IN OUR PATIENT NORMAL LEVATOR FUNCTION, COMPLETELY RECOVERED PTOSIS AND BETTER, BUT STILL REDUCED, EYE MOVEMENT AND STRABISMUS WERE PRESENT AFTER 2.5 MONTHS. FURTHER REPORTED COMPLICATIONS OF OPHTHALMIC ARTERY OCCLUSION WERE ANTERIOR SEGMENT ISCHEMIA, AS WAS FOUND IN OUR PATIENT, IRIS ATROPHY AND PHTHISIS BULBI ON THE LONG TERM. AFTER 2.5 MONTHS, IRREGULAR WIDENED PUPIL WITHOUT IRIS ATROPHY OR IRIS ISCHEMIA BUT MILD HYPEREMIA OF THE IRIS WERE OBVIOUS IN OUR CASE. WE FOUND AN EARLY ENOPHTHALMOS OF THE AFFECTED EYE, WHICH WAS ALSO REPORTED FROM ANOTHER GROUP AFTER 6 MONTHS OF FOLLOW-UP. A PHTHISIS BULBI OR EVEN ENUCLEATION IN THE FURTHER COURSE CANNOT BE EXCLUDED. FURTHER KNOWN COMPLICATIONS LIKE BRAIN INFARCTS OR HEMORRHAGE WERE RULED OUT IN OUR PATIENT. IN OUR CASE, THE IMMEDIATE THERAPY CONSISTED OF ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID, TINZAPARIN SODIUM, CORTICOSTEROIDS AND OBSERVATION. REGARDING THE LACK OF THROMBOTIC CAUSE OF THE OCCLUSION, NO INTRA-ARTERIAL THROMBOLYSIS WAS RECOMMENDED. DUE TO EXTENSIVE ISCHEMIC RETINAL AND NEUROPATHIC CHANGES ALREADY AT TIME OF PRESENTATION, THE LACK OF BENEFIT ACCORDING TO LITERATURE AND TO MINIMIZE FURTHER, POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS, NO HYALURONIDASE INJECTIONS, EXCEPT ON THE FOREHEAD, WERE PERFORMED SINCE VISUAL REHABILITATION WAS NOT TO BE EXPECTED. IN THE ANGIOGRAPHY AN OPHTHALMIC ARTERY OCCLUSION COULD NOT BE ASCERTAINED OR RULED OUT. BUT THE SUBSEQUENT COMPLICATIONS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE BRANCHES OF THE OPHTHALMIC ARTERY, BEARING IN MIND INTERINDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES AND ANASTOMOSES, AND WERE ALSO DESCRIBED IN OTHER STUDIES AS MENTIONED ABOVE. FURTHER FINDINGS LIKE THE MISSING CHERRY ROT SPOT DUE TO RETINAL AND CHOROIDAL INSUFFICIENCY, EXTENSIVE, WHITISH, EDEMATOUS RETINAL ISCHEMIA, POOR OR NO RETINAL ARTERY FILLING AND DISC EDEMA ARE SEEN IN OPHTHALMIC ARTERY OCCLUSION. DUE TO THE RESTRICTED TREATMENT POSSIBILITIES AND VERY POOR OUTCOME THE FURTHER COURSE REMAINS TO BE SEEN. CONCLUSION: THE OUTCOME OF OPHTHALMIC ARTERY OCCLUSION FOLLOWING GLABELLAR HYALURONIC ACID FILLER INJECTION IS VERY POOR. IT WAS ESSENTIAL THAT THE PRACTITIONER HAS SUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE ABOUT FACIAL ANATOMY, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROCEDURE AND MANAGEMENT OF COMPLICATIONS. THE PRACTITIONER SHOULD BE AWARE OF POTENTIAL DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES AND INFORM THE PATIENT SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THIS RARE COMPLICATION, SINCE THEY MIGHT BE IRREVERSIBLE AND FAR-REACHING. COMPANY COMMENT: THE SERIOUS EVENTS OF BLINDNESS UNILATERAL, OPHTHALMIC ARTERY OCCLUSION, OPHTHALMOPLEGIA, OPTIC ISCHAEMIC NEUROPATHY, ANTERIOR SEGMENT ISCHAEMIA, RETINAL ISCHAEMIA AND IMPLANT SITE NECROSIS WERE CONSIDERED EXPECTED AND POSSIBLY RELATED TO THE TREATMENT. SERIOUSNESS CRITERIA INCLUDED THE NEED FOR MULTIPLE MEDICAL INTERVENTIONS AND PERMANENT DAMAGE. THE NON-SERIOUS, EXPECTED EVENTS OF ERYTHEMA, SWELLING AND HAEMORRHAGE AT IMPLANT SITE, CUTANEOUS CONTOUR DEFORMITY, EYELID PTOSIS, ENOPHTHALMOS, STRABISMUS, PAPILLOEDEMA, CORNEAL OEDEMA, CONJUNCTIVAL OEDEMA, RETINAL OEDEMA, CHOROIDAL EFFUSION AND THE UNEXPECTED EVENTS OF LAGOPHTHALMOS, MADAROSIS, HYPOTONY OF EYE, CORNEAL EROSION, PUPILLARY REFLEX IMPAIRED, CONJUNCTIVAL HYPERAEMIA, IRIS ATROPHY, ATROPHY OF GLOBE, RETINAL DEGENERATION AND VITREOUS DETACHMENT WERE CONSIDERED POSSIBLY RELATED TO THE TREATMENT. IRIS ATROPHY, ATROPHY OF GLOBE, RETINAL DEGENERATION AND VITREOUS DETACHMENT WERE CONSIDERED TO BE SECONDARY EVENTS OF THE OPHTHALMIC ARTERY OCCLUSION. THE POTENTIAL ROOT CAUSE INCLUDE INTRAVASCULAR FILLER INJECTION LEADING TO VASCULAR OCCLUSION AND ITS MANIFESTATIONS. POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTORY FACTORS INCLUDE INJECTION TECHNIQUE AND TREATMENT PERFORMED BY A NON-MEDICAL PRACTITIONER. THE CASE MEETS THE CRITERIA FOR EXPEDITED REPORTING TO THE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. FINAL MANUFACTURER COMMENT: ROUTINE INVESTIGATIONS HAVE BEEN PERFORMED AND PROVIDE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL ROOT CAUSE AND INDICATE A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION TO THE TREATMENT PROCEDURE. LOT NUMBER WAS NOT REPORTED AND THE PRODUCT COULD NOT BE VERIFIED. THE INFORMATION IN THIS CASE DOES NOT INDICATE A NON-CONFORMING PRODUCT OR MALFUNCTION. THE PERFORMED INVESTIGATIONS ARE THEREFORE CONSIDERED ADEQUATE AND NO ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATIONS WILL BE CONDUCTED. CAPA COMMENT: NO CORRECTIVE OR PREVENTIVE ACTIONS ARE DEEMED NECESSARY BASED ON THE OUTCOME OF THE PERFORMED INVESTIGATIONS.

THE ISSUE WAS FIRST IDENTIFIED DURING POST OPERATIVE EXAMS. DAILY ACTIVITIES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED. THROUGH FOLLOW UP, WE LEARNED THAT THE DOCTOR THOUGHT THAT 10% TO 20% OF HIS PATIENTS HAD THESE SYMPTOMS, BUT THE DOCTOR DID NOT KNOW HOW MANY PATIENTS WERE INVOLVED. THE DOCTOR SUBSEQUENTLY TREATED SOME OF THESE PATIENTS WITH A VITREOLYSIS LASER, AND THE SYMPTOMS THEN REDUCED OR DISAPPEARED. IT WAS ALSO UNKNOWN HOW MANY PATIENTS RECEIVED THE VITREOLYSIS LASER TREATMENT. VISUAL ACUITY AFTERWARDS WAS GOOD. THE DOCTOR THINKS THAT THE INTRAOCULAR LENS (IOL) PROVIDES VERY HIGH CONTRASTS, WHICH HE THINKS COULD BE CAUSED BY THE OPTIBLUE FILTER.

ON (B)(6) 2022 I HAD A SURGICAL PROCEDURE TO REPLACE THE LENS THAT WAS INSERTED DURING CATARACT SURGERY DONE IN (B)(6) 2021 TO GIVE ME BETTER DISTANCE VISION. ON THE MORNING OF (B)(6) 2022 I WOKE UP NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE OUT OF THAT EYE - IT WAS PURE WHITE, LIKE LOOKING THROUGH A CLOUD. I CALLED MY OPHTHALMOLOGIST'S OFFICE AND WAS TOLD TO COME IN. THE DOCTOR SUSPECTED TASS, AS MY CORNEA WAS EXTREMELY SWOLLEN. HE HAD ME USE PREDNISOLONE ACETATE EYE DROPS EVERY HOUR AND TOLD ME TO RETURN IN 4 DAYS. WHEN I RETURNED IN 4 DAYS, THERE WAS LITTLE IMPROVEMENT. I STILL COULDN'T SEE PROPERLY - ONLY SHAPES AND SOME COLORS THROUGH A CLOUD, OR GAUZE EFFECT. HE THEN TOLD ME TO USE THE DROPS EVERY 2 HOURS AND TAKE VALACYCLOVIR (MEDICATION I HAVE FOR COLD SORES) SEVERAL TIMES A DAY FOR 10 DAYS TO RULE OUT THAT THE VIRUS HAD TRAVELED TO MY EYE. I CAME BACK ON (B)(6) 2022 AND THE SWELLING SHOWED VERY MINIMAL IMPROVEMENT AROUND THE EDGES OF THE CORNEA. I STILL COULD NOT SEE PROPERLY, ALTHOUGH BY THE END OF THE DAY I WAS ABLE TO MAKE OUT OBJECTS AND PEOPLE, BUT STILL NOT ABLE TO READ ANY SIGNS OR SEE WITHOUT BLURRED VISION. I WAS TOLD TO FINISH UP THE VALACYCLOVIR FOR THE 10 DAYS AND JUST DO THE STEROID DROPS 4 TIMES A DAY AND COME BACK IN 2 WEEKS. I WAS ALSO TOLD THERE WAS ANOTHER PATIENT WHO HAD EYE SURGERY ON THE SAME DAY I DID WHO HAD EXTREME CORNEAL EDEMA, BUT THE DOCTOR SAID THAT PERSON HAD OTHER CONTRIBUTING FACTORS AND THEIR CASE PROBABLY WASN'T TASS. HE ALSO TOLD ME HE REPORTED THIS TO THE HOSPITAL (BOTH CASES). I CAME BACK ON (B)(6) 2022 AND WAS TOLD THERE WAS NOT AS MUCH IMPROVEMENT AS HE'D LIKE TO HAVE SEEN AFTER THIS AMOUNT OF TIME. I WAS ABLE TO MAKE OUT A COUPLE LETTERS ON THE EYE CHART, BUT ONLY AT THE LARGEST IMAGE. I WAS TOLD TO KEEP USING THE DROPS 4 TIMES A DAY AND COME BACK IN 4 WEEKS. I WAS GIVING HANDOUTS WITH INFORMATION ON CORNEAL TRANSPLANT SURGERIES. AS YOU COULD "IMAGE," I WAS QUITE DISTRAUGHT BY THIS - I DID GO FOR A SECOND OPINION ON (B)(6) 2022 BY A HIGHLY RESPECTED AND RECOMMENDED OPHTHALMOLOGIST WHO WAS ALSO UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT I HAD TASS AS A RESULT OF THE SURGERY ON (B)(6) 2022. I AM STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS NIGHTMARE, AND NOT SURE WHAT TO DO AT THIS POINT. MY NEXT FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENT IS (B)(6) 2022. FDA SAFETY REPORT ID# (B)(4).

ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO OBTAIN THE MISSING INFORMATION; HOWEVER, NO RESPONSE HAS BEEN RECEIVED. ALL PERTINENT INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO JOHNSON & JOHNSON SURGICAL VISION, INC. HAS BEEN SUBMITTED. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT IS EXPERIENCING POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE DYSPHOTOPSIA WITH INTRAOCULAR LENS (IOL) IN HER RIGHT EYE POST IOL IMPLANT. THE PATIENT DESCRIBED EXPERIENCING A VIBRATION IN HER EYE SINCE SURGERY. SHE SAID IT IS NOT VISIBLE TO SOMEONE LOOKING AT HER. IT IS RELATED TO HOW HER EYE IS CATCHING THE REFLECTION OF LIGHT WITH THE NEW LENS. SHE FEELS HER BRAIN IS NOT ADAPTING TO THE NEW LENS. SHE STATED SHE SEES DARK SPOTS THAT ARE MORE LIKE MAGNIFIED WATER DROPLETS OR BLACK LINES WITH A HALO BEHIND IT. THE PATIENT SEES AS A GHOST IMAGE ON HER LEFT SIDE, THAT IS NOT JUST IN THE CORNER, BUT CLOSER TO THE INSIDE TOO. WHEN SHE BLINKS IT FEELS LIKE IT IS OUT OF FOCUS. SHE SAID IT IS NOT, DOUBLE VISION, BUT A GHOST VISION. THIS MAKES HER FEEL ANXIOUS AND DIZZY. SHE IS CONCERNED ABOUT DRIVING. SHE SAID SHE CAN DRIVE, BUT DOES NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE DOING SO BECAUSE THE ABERRATIONS MAKE HER FEEL LIKE SHE CAN NOT SEE. THE PATIENT MENTIONED SHE EXPERIENCED A LOT OF EDEMA AFTER SURGERY. SHE SPOKE TO HER DOCTOR, WHO SAID THE LENS IS ATTACHED CORRECTLY AND SHE IS HEALING PERFECTLY. HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS CAUSING HER VISUAL DISTURBANCES, BUT WAS GOING TO REACH OUT TO JOHNSON & JOHNSON FOR ANSWERS. HE MENTIONED POTENTIALLY EXCHANGING THE LENS, BUT SHE REALLY DOES NOT WANT TO DO THIS, BECAUSE OF HER EXPERIENCE WITH THIS EYE. SHE ALSO SAID SHE MAY JUST LET HER LEFT EYE GO BLIND INSTEAD OF HAVING SURGERY. THE PATIENT FEELS THE LENS IS DOING ITS JOB AND NOTICED RIGHT AFTER SURGERY, SHE CRIED BECAUSE THE COLORS WERE SO VIVID. ALTHOUGH SHE CAN SEE WELL IN HER HOME AND IN THE DARK, SHE DOES NOT SEE AS WELL AS SHE WOULD LIKE IN OTHER SITUATIONS. THE PATIENT HAS NOT NOTICED AN IMPROVEMENT IN HER DISTANCE VISION, CANNOT READ HER CELL PHONE, AND THE INTERIOR OF HER CAR IS NOT AS CLEAR; HOWEVER IT IS BETTER THAN WHEN SHE HAD BEFORE THE CATARACT. SHE IS USING PRESCRIPTION GLASSES TO SEE UP CLOSE, AND USES SUNGLASSES TO ASSIST WITH THE GLARE (WHICH IS DESCRIBED AS A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT). THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THE ISSUES MENTIONED ABOVE. SHE IS TAKING ARGENTYN23 BY CHOICE, A HOMEOPATHIC MEDICATION WHICH SHE DESCRIBED AS AN ANTIVIRAL MEDICINE SHE USED TO HELP WITH STYES AND EYE CYSTS. SHE SAID AFTER SURGERY IT EASED DISCOMFORT SHE FELT. SHE CALLED THE MANUFACTURER OF ARGENTYN23 AND THEY SAID TO REACH OUT TO THE MANUFACTURER OF THE LENS. SHE ASKED HER SURGEON AND HER REGULAR DOCTOR AND THEY DID NOT KNOW IF SHE WOULD REACT WITH MEDICATION AND IOL. THE PATIENT ENJOYS USING THIS, AND WANTS TO CONTINUE. HOWEVER, SHE WANTS TO MAKE SURE THIS IS NOT CONTRIBUTING TO HER VISUAL ISSUES. SHE THINKS SHE HAD DENSE CATARACTS. SHE WAS PRESCRIBED 5% SODIUM DROPS FOR EDEMA AFTER THE SURGERY CALLED AMERO. IN ADDITION, SHE IS TAKING PRED-MOXI 4 X DAY AND PROLENTA X 1 A DAY, WHICH SHE SAID WERE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY MEDICATIONS. THE PATIENT HAS NOT SPOKEN TO A PHARMACIST REGARDING ANY NEGATIVE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THESE MEDICATION AND THE ARGENTYN23. THE PATIENT SAID SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN LIGHT SENSITIVE, EVEN BEFORE SURGERY. SHE IS A VISUAL ARTIST BY OCCUPATION. SHE HAS NO OTHER HEALTH OR EYE HEALTH ISSUES. THROUGH FOLLOW-UP, IT WAS LEARNED THAT HER DOCTOR DIAGNOSED HER WITH NEGATIVE DYSPHOTOPSIA AND POSITIVE DYSPHOTOPSIA. THE PATIENT DID NOT KNOW THE LOCATION OF HER EDEMA, NOR, DID NOT KNOW IF THE EDEMA PERSISTS. HOWEVER, THE PATIENT CONFIRMED SHE IS STILL TAKING SALINE DROPS FOR THE EDEMA AND IS NOT PART OF STANDARD OF CARE. THE PATIENT ALSO CONFIRMED THE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY MEDICATIONS: PRED-MOXI 4 X DAY; PROLENTA X 1 A DAY, WERE STANDARD OF CARE MEDICATIONS HER DOCTOR PRESCRIBED AFTER SURGERY. THE PATIENT'S VISION HAS CLEARED A BIT, BUT NOW SHE IS DEALING WITH A CHALAZION CYST WHICH IS INTERFERING WITH HER VISION. THE PATIENT MENTIONED SHE HAS HAD A HISTORY OF HAVING A CHALAZION CYST. THEREFORE, SHE HAS SEEN HER DOCTOR WEEKLY DUE TO THE CYST. THE PATIENT STATED SHE IS TAKING A HOMEOPATHIC, ANTIVIRAL MEDICINE CALLED ARGENTYN 23. ARGENTYN 23 HAS HELPED HER WITH THE CYST BEFORE AND CONTINUES TO USE IT TO TREAT THE CHALAZION EYE CYST. AS FOR NOW, THE LENS REMAINS IMPLANTED. THE PATIENT IS NOT WILLING TO DO ANY OTHER SURGERY UNTIL HER CYST GOES AWAY. HER DOCTOR HAS GIVEN HER THE OPTION TO EITHER EXCHANGE THE LENS OR DO A REVERSE OPTIC CAPTURE IF SHE CONTINUES TO HAVE THESE VISUAL ISSUES. HOWEVER, PATIENT MADE IT VERY CLEAR SHE IS NOT MAKING ANY DECISIONS UNTIL HER CYST IS GONE. NO OTHER INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED.

THE USED COMPLAINT COMPANY CARTRIDGE WAS NOT RETURNED. TWO OPENED 10-COUNT CARTONS WERE RETURNED FOR LOT # 15302880. ONE SAMPLE WAS PULLED FROM EACH RETURNED CARTON. THE COMPANY CARTRIDGES WERE NUMBERED 1-2 FOR EVALUATION PURPOSES. THERE HAS BEEN EIGHT OTHER COMPLAINTS REPORTED IN THE LOT NUMBER. THE RETURNED UNOPENED COMPANY CARTRIDGES WERE EVALUATED. THE COMPANY CARTRIDGES WERE OPENED AND MICROSCOPICALLY EXAMINED WITH NO DAMAGE OBSERVED. NO PARTICULATE WAS OBSERVED INSIDE THE CARTRIDGE LUMENS. THE COMPANY CARTRIDGES WERE FUNCTIONALLY TESTED PER THE DIRECTIONS FOR USE (DFU). NO LENS OR CARTRIDGE DAMAGE WAS OBSERVED AFTER THE LENS DELIVERIES. NO FOREIGN MATERIAL WAS OBSERVED. THE CARTRIDGES WERE CLEANED FOR FURTHER EVALUATION. TOP COAT DYE STAIN TESTING WAS CONDUCTED WITH ACCEPTABLE RESULTS.

NO FOREIGN MATERIAL WAS OBSERVED. FUNCTIONAL AND DYE STAIN TESTING WAS CONDUCTED WITH THE UNOPENED SAMPLES WITH ACCEPTABLE RESULTS. NO FOREIGN MATERIAL WAS OBSERVED AFTER THE FUNCTIONAL TESTING. PER THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU): THE COMPANY DEVICE IOL DELIVERY SYSTEM IS FOR IMPLANTATION OF QUALIFIED COMPANY FOLDABLE IOLS. NO UNQUALIFIED LENSES SHOULD BE USED WITH THE COMPANY ¿ IOL DELIVERY SYSTEM. THE COMPANY CARTRIDGES ARE QUALIFIED FOR USE WITH COMPATIBLE COMPANY ¿ HANDPIECES FOR THE SURGICAL IMPLANTATION OF COMPANY QUALIFIED FOLDABLE IOLS. COMPANY FOLDABLE IOLS ARE QUALIFIED FOR USE WITH AN COMPANY QUALIFIED DELIVERY SYSTEM (HANDPIECE AND CARTRIDGE) AND OPHTHALMIC VISCOSURGICAL DEVICE (OVD) COMBINATION. THE USE OF AN UNQUALIFIED COMBINATION MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE IOL AND POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS DURING THE IMPLANTATION PROCESS. THE IFU INSTRUCTS ALSO TO COMPLETELY FILL THE CARTRIDGE WITH OPHTHALMIC VISCOSURGICAL DEVICE (OVD) (DIAGRAM PROVIDED) IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO LOADING AND DELIVERY OF THE LENS. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO LOAD THE LENS WITHOUT ADEQUATE OVD IN THE DEVICE. NOT ADEQUATELY FILLING THE DEVICE WITH VISCOELASTIC WILL RESULT IN INADEQUATE COVERAGE OF LENS AND THE LENS FOLD PATH WITH OVD, WHICH MAY RESULT IN DAMAGE. THE MANUFACTURER INTERNAL REFERENCE NUMBER IS: (B)(4). A PHYSICIAN REPORTED THAT DURING AN INTRAOCULAR LENS (IOL) IMPLANT PROCEDURE, FOREIGN MATERIAL LIKE A PIECE OF THREAD CAME OUT OF THE CARTRIDGE IMPLANTING IOL. THE SURGERY WAS COMPLETED AFTER REPLACING THE PRODUCT WITH ANOTHER ONE. THE FOREIGN MATERIAL WAS ASPIRATED AND REMOVED. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS REQUESTED AND RECEIVED IT WAS CONFIRMED TO THE SALES REP THAT THE SURGERY WAS COMPLETED WITHOUT REPLACING THE PRODUCT. THERE WAS NO PROBLEM/HARM TO THE PATIENT AFTER THE SURGERY.
A SAMPLE DEVICE WAS NOT RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS. PRODUCT HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED AND DOCUMENTATION INDICATED THE PRODUCT MET RELEASE CRITERIA. ROOT CAUSE HAS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED. THERE HAS BEEN TWO OTHER COMPLAINTS REPORTED IN THE LOT NUMBER. THE MANUFACTURER INTERNAL REFERENCE NUMBER IS: (B)(4). A MATERIALS MANGER REPORTED THAT FOLLOWING AN INTRAOCULAR LENS (IOL) IMPLANT PROCEDURE, THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED UNCOMFORTABLE, CAN NOT SEE. THE IOL WAS EXCHANGED IN A SECONDARY PROCEDURE FOLLOWING THE INITIAL PROCEDURE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN REQUESTED AND PROVIDED THAT REPORTING IOL WAS PLACED INTO THE CAPSULAR BAG. POSTOP THE IOL WAS SLIGHTLY DECENTERED LIKELY SECONDARY TO CAPSULAR RUPTURE OR ZONULAR WEAKNESS. PATIENT WAS UNHAPPY WITH VISION FROM DECENTERED IOL. THERE WAS NO PATIENT HARM.
A CONSUMER REPORTED FOLLOWING AN INTRAOCULAR LENS IMPLANT PROCEDURE ON (B)(6) 2021 IN HER LEFT EYE, SHE EXPERIENCED BLURRINESS AND SEVERE DRY EYE. IT HAS INTERFERED WITH QUALITY OF LIFE, DRIVING AND PERFORMANCE AT WORK. THE VISION GOT WORSE. IT WAS LIKE HAVING A CLOUD OR FOG IN FRONT OF EYE. SHE ALSO DEVELOPED SCAR TISSUE WHICH WAS ALSO GIVING ME DISTORTION IN ADDITION TO THE BLURRINESS AND FLOATERS. SHE CONSULTED 3 OPHTHALMOLOGIST AND 2 RETINA SPECIALIST, BUT NO ONE WERE ABLE TO MAKE OUT THE CAUSE OF HER BLURRY VISION. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN REQUESTED. A SAMPLE DEVICE WAS NOT RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS. COMPLAINT HISTORY AND PRODUCT HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED AND DOCUMENTATION INDICATED THE PRODUCT MET RELEASE CRITERIA. ROOT CAUSE HAS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED. THERE HAVE BEEN NO OTHER COMPLAINTS REPORTED IN THE LOT NUMBER. THE MANUFACTURER INTERNAL REFERENCE NUMBER IS: (B)(4).
THE USED DEVICE WITH THE LENS WAS RETURNED LOOSE INSIDE THE CARTON. THE PLUNGER LOCK AND LENS STOP HAVE BEEN REMOVED. THE PLUNGER WAS ORIENTED INCORRECTLY. VISCOELASTIC WAS OBSERVED IN THE DEVICE. THE PLUNGER HAS BEEN ADVANCED OVER THE TRAILING PORTION OF THE OPTIC. THE LENS WAS PARTIALLY ADVANCED INTO THE NOZZLE ENTRY. ALL PRODUCT AND BATCH HISTORY RECORDS ARE QUALITY REVIEWED PRIOR TO PRODUCT RELEASE. THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE REPORTED COMPLAINT OF "LENS WOULD NOT ADVANCE" CANNOT BE DETERMINED. THE USED DEVICE WAS INSPECTED. A PLUNGER OVERRIDE WAS OBSERVED. UPON RETURN, THE PLUNGER WAS OBSERVED TO BE ORIENTED INCORRECTLY IN THE DEVICE. IT CANNOT BE DETERMINED IF THE PLUNGER MAY HAVE BEEN INADVERTENTLY RETRACTED OUTSIDE OF THE DEVICE AND REINSERTED INCORRECTLY BY THE CUSTOMER. THERE HAVE BEEN NO OTHER COMPLAINTS REPORTED IN THE LOT NUMBER. ALTHOUGH THE PLUNGER ORIENTATION CANNOT BE RULED OUT AS A POTENTIAL CAUSE, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE DEVICE WAS MANUFACTURED INCORRECTLY. PLUNGER PLACEMENT IS CONDUCTED WITH A PLUNGER/MAIN BODY ASSEMBLY FIXTURE. THE FIXTURE BY DESIGN ENSURES THE PROPER ORIENTATION AND PLACEMENT OF THE PLUNGER IN THE DEVICE. IT IS UNKNOWN IF A QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC WAS USED. THE INSTRUCTION FOR USE (IFU) INSTRUCTS: DURING DEVICE PREPARATION AND IMPLANTATION OF THE IOL WITH THE PRELOADED DELIVERY SYSTEM, AN ALCON QUALIFIED OPHTHALMIC VISCOELASTIC DEVICE (OVD) SHOULD BE USED. THE USE OF AN UNQUALIFIED OVD MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE LENS AND POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS DURING THE DEVICE PREPARATION AND IMPLANTATION STEPS. PLUNGER OVERRIDE MAY OCCUR: DUE TO RAPID ADVANCEMENT FASTER THAN THE IFU RECOMMEND RATE. DUE TO THE USE OF A NON-QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC. MATERIAL PROPERTIES OF NON-QUALIFIED OVDS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO UNDERFILL, OVERFILL, MISFOLDING OF THE HAPTICS, OR OTHER INCONSISTENT FOLDING OUTCOMES. IF INADEQUATE VISCOELASTIC IS PLACED IN THE DEVICE THIS WILL CAUSE INADEQUATE COVERAGE OF THE LENS FOLD PATH WHICH MAY CAUSE THE LENS TO ADVANCE INCORRECTLY OR BECOME ¿STUCK¿ IN THE DEVICE ALLOWING THE PLUNGER TO OVERRIDE THE LENS. IF THE DEVICE IS OVERFILLED WITH OVD, THIS CAN PREVENT THE TRAILING HAPTIC FROM BEING PLACED PROPERLY OR MOVE THE LENS OUT OF POSITION RESULTING IN MISFOLDING. IF THE OPERATING ROOM TEMPERATURE IS TOO HIGH (> 23°C / 73° F) LENS FOLDING CONSISTENCY IS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED, THE LENS IS MORE ADHERENT AND THIS MAY INHIBIT LENS ADVANCEMENT. ANY OF THE ABOVE LISTED CAUSES ALONE, OR IN COMBINATION, MAY CREATE THE REPORTED EVENT. A PREVIOUS TRACKWISE MANUFACTURING INVESTIGATION WAS OPENED TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL FOR THE PLUNGER TO BE ORIENTED INCORRECTLY DURING MANUFACTURING. THE PLUNGER FIXTURE IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE THE PLUNGER CANNOT BE INSERTED IN THE INCORRECT ORIENTATION. THE FIXTURES WERE EVALUATED, AND ALL FIXTURES WERE DESIGNED AS INTENDED. ALL FIXTURES WORKED AS INTENDED AND DID NOT ALLOW THE PLUNGER TO BE INSERTED ORIENTED INCORRECTLY UNLESS EXCESSIVE FORCE WAS APPLIED. AN ENHANCEMENT WAS MADE TO ALL FIXTURES TO MAKE THE DESIGN MORE ROBUST SO THAT FORCE CANNOT BE USED TO OVERRIDE THE DESIGN FEATURE. BASED ON OUR CURRENT TRACKING, THERE ARE NO ADVERSE TRENDS FOR THIS REPORTED COMPLAINT. NO FURTHER ACTION WARRANTED AT THIS TIME. THE MANUFACTURER INTERNAL REFERENCE NUMBER IS: (B)(4). A NON HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL REPORTED DURING AN INTRAOCULAR LENS IMPLANT PROCEDURE, THE LENS WOULD NOT ADVANCE IN THE INSERTER. IT WAS NOT USED HOWEVER PATIENT CONTACT WAS OBSERVED. THE PROCEDURE WAS COMPLETED WITH A NEW LENS DURING THE INITIAL PROCEDURE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN REQUESTED.

THE EVENT OF FIBROSIS IS A PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLICATION AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THIS EVENT. MULTIPLE REQUESTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION HAVE BEEN MADE. ALLERGAN HAS RECEIVED NO RESPONSE FROM THE AUTHORS. THE ARTICLE "THE USE OF FIXATION SUTURE TO TREAT INFERONASAL HYPERTROPHIC BLEB AFTER XEN GEL STENT IMPLANT: A CASE REPORT. CASE REPORTS IN OPHTHALMOLOGY, 2022" REPORTED THE FOLLOWING CASE STUDY. THE PATIENT UNDERWENT A RIGHT-EYE PHACOEMULSIFICATION AND INTRAOCULAR LENS IMPLANTATION COMBINED WITH XEN GEL STENT AB INTERNO IMPLANTATION SURGERY. 2 WEEKS POST-OPERATION, IOP INCREASED TO 23 MMHG WITH REPORTS OF FIBROSIS AND A FLAT BLEB. NEEDLING WAS PERFORMED AND MAXITROL DROPS WERE PROVIDED, WHICH RESOLVED EVENTS. 4 WEEKS POST-OP., IOP INCREASED AGAIN TO 30 MMHG AND A NONFUNCTIONING BLEB WAS NOTED. A SECOND NEEDLING WAS PERFORMED, RESULTING IN STABLE IOP. A MONTH LATER, PATIENT REPORTED DISCOMFORT, REDNESS, AND IRRITATION; EXAMINATION NOTED LARGE HYPERTROPHIC BLEB WITH SCARRING. MAXITROL DROPS WERE PROVIDED, WHICH RESOLVED CONJUNCTIVAL INFLAMMATION. A BLEB REVISION WAS PERFORMED TO SEPARATE THE FIBROSIS AROUND THE IMPLANT AND CORRECT DRAINAGE FLOW, RESULTING IN FULL VISUAL RECOVERY. FOLLOW-UP VISIT AT 20 MONTHS, NOTED IOP AND BCVA REMAIN STABLE AT 13 MMHG AND 20/20, RESPECTIVELY.
A NON-HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL REPORTED THAT FOLLOWING THE INTRAOCULAR LENS IMPLANT SURGERY, THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED BLURRY VISION, HYPEROPIC SURPRISE. THE IOL WAS EXCHANGED IN A SECONDARY PROCEDURE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS REQUESTED. A SAMPLE DEVICE WAS NOT RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS. COMPLAINT HISTORY AND PRODUCT HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED AND THE DOCUMENTATION INDICATED THE PRODUCT MET RELEASE CRITERIA. THE ROOT CAUSE HAS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED.

DAMAGED HAPTIC AFTER IMPLANTATION. THE DOCTOR EXPLANTED THE IOL FROM THE EYE SINCE HE NOTICED BOTH HAPTICS WERE SEPARATED AT THE TIP JUST AFTER IMPLANTATION. PATIENT IMPACT: INTRA-OPERATIVE EXPLANTATION. THIS INITIAL REPORT IS BEING SUBMITTED TO FDA FOR A REPORTABLE EVENT THAT OCCURRED OUTSIDE THE USA. HAPTIC DAMAGE IS INDICATED AS A POTENTIAL MALFUNCTION RELATED TO THE IOL, AS COVERED UNDER THE WARNINGS SECTION OF THE PRODUCT'S INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU). PORTIONS OF THE PRODUCT WERE RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER. THE INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED, WITH THE METHODS AND RESULTS AS NOTED BELOW. THE INJECTOR AND IOL WERE AVAILABLE FOR INVESTIGATION. ONE HAPTIC PIECE REMAINED AROUND THE SLIDER. ANOTHER HAPTIC PIECE WAS EJECTED AND NOT RETURNED. APPEARANCE CHECK RESULT WAS CONSISTENT TO REPORTED INFORMATION. NO ABNORMALITIES WERE FOUND IN PRODUCTION AND INSPECTION RECORDS OF THE PRODUCT. (SERIAL NO.: (B)(4); MODEL: 255). THE DYE TEST RESULT SHOWED THE INJECTOR TIP WAS PROPERLY COATED.

THE BROKEN HAPTIC WAS RETURNED INSIDE A FOLDED WHITE PIECE OF PAPER. PICTURES WERE AVAILABLE THAT MATCHED THE RETURNED PRODUCT. PRODUCT HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED AND DOCUMENTATION INDICATED THE PRODUCT MET RELEASE CRITERIA. A QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC WAS INDICATED. THE ROOT CAUSE COULD NOT BE DETERMINED FOR THE REPORTED COMPLAINT. A BROKEN HAPTIC WAS RETURNED OUTSIDE OF DEVICE. THE PLUNGER WAS RETRACTED UPON RETURN. THE PLUNGER POSITION IN RELATION TO THE BROKEN HAPTIC DURING ADVANCEMENT CANNOT BE DETERMINED. THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU) INSTRUCTS: AFTER THE LENS HAS BEEN ADVANCED TO THE NOZZLE LINE, THE LENS SHOULD BE VISUALLY INSPECTED TO DETERMINE THE POSITION OF THE HAPTICS. THE PLUNGER SHOULD BE IN CONTACT WITH THE TRAILING OPTIC EDGE. AFTER CONFIRMING THE LENS IS PROPERLY POSITIONED AND THE HAPTICS ARE FOLDED PROPERLY, PROCEED WITH LENS IMPLANTATION. PROCEEDING WITH IMPLANTATION OF A MISFOLDED HAPTIC OR A LENS THAT APPEARS TO BE ¿OUT OF POSITION¿ CAN RESULT IN A BROKEN HAPTIC OR OTHER NEGATIVE OUTCOME, SINCE THE HAPTIC MAY BE TRAPPED AND STRETCHED, AND/OR PINCHED AND SHEARED BY THE MOVING PLUNGER. A QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC WAS INDICATED. UPDATED INFORMATION INDICATED THAT THE PLANNED EXPLANT OCCURRED AND THE IOL WAS SUCCESSFULLY EXPLANTED. NO FURTHER INFORMATION HAS BEEN PROVIDED. THERE ARE NO OTHER COMPLAINTS IN THIS LOT. BROKEN HAPTICS MAY OCCUR: IF THE OPERATING ROOM TEMPERATURE IS TOO HIGH (> 23°C / 73° F) LENS FOLDING CONSISTENCY IS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED, THE LENS IS MORE ADHERENT AND THIS MAY INHIBIT LENS ADVANCEMENT. IN ADDITION, HAPTIC STRENGTH (MODULUS) DECREASES AS THE TEMPERATURE INCREASES AND IS MORE LIKELY TO BREAK UNDER STRESS. IF THE DEVICE IS OVERFILLED WITH OPHTHALMIC VISCOELASTIC DEVICES (OVD) AS THIS CAN PREVENT THE TRAILING HAPTIC FROM BEING PLACED PROPERLY OR MOVE THE LENS OUT OF POSITION RESULTING IN MISFOLDING. IF A STRAIGHT TRAILING HAPTIC OCCURS AND IT WAS NOT PROPERLY DETECTED TO BE OUT OF POSITION. IF THE PLUNGER IS NOT FULLY ADVANCED, OR IF THE PLUNGER IS ALLOWED TO RETRACT, THE TRAILING HAPTIC MAY NOT RELEASE PROPERLY FROM THE DEVICE. ANY OF THE ABOVE LISTED CAUSES ALONE, OR IN COMBINATION, MAY CREATE THE REPORTED EVENT. THE MANUFACTURER INTERNAL REFERENCE NUMBER IS: (B)(4). AN OPHTHALMOLOGIST REPORTED THAT DURING AN INTRAOCULAR LENS (IOL) IMPLANT PROCEDURE, TRAILING HAPTIC OF INVOLVED ULTRASERT WAS CUTOFF DURING IOL IMPLANTATION.

A NURSE REPORTED THAT DURING AN INTRAOCULAR LENS (IOL) IMPLANT PROCEDURE, THE LENS WAS BEING INSERTED INTO THE EYE THE CARTRIDGE WAS SPLIT AT THE DISTAL END. NO MORE FURTHER INFORMATION AVAILABLE. A USED COMPANY CARTRIDGE WAS RETURNED ROLLED UP IN THE OPENED COMPANY POUCH. VISCOELASTIC IS OBSERVED IN THE CARTRIDGE. THE CARTRIDGE HAS A LARGE ANEURYSM ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE TIP. HEAVY STRESS IS ALSO OBSERVED. THE CARTRIDGE DOES NOT HAVE EVIDENCE OF BEING FULLY SEATED IN A HANDPIECE. THE CARTRIDGE WAS CLEANED FOR FURTHER EVALUATION. TOP COAT DYE STAIN TESTING WAS CONDUCTED WITH ACCEPTABLE RESULTS. PRODUCT HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED AND DOCUMENTATION INDICATED THE PRODUCT MET RELEASE CRITERIA. ASSOCIATED PRODUCTS WERE NOT PROVIDED. IT IS UNKNOWN IF QUALIFIED PRODUCTS WERE USED. THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE REPORTED DAMAGE COULD NOT BE DETERMINED. THE TIP OF THE CARTRIDGE HAD A LARGE ANEURYSM WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN INTERPRETED AS THE REPORTED CRACK. THERE WAS EVIDENCE THAT THE CARTRIDGE HAD NOT BEEN FULLY SEATED IN THE HANDPIECE. THIS MAY HAVE CAUSED THE LENS/PLUNGER TO ADVANCE INCORRECTLY. THE HANDPIECE IFU (INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE) INSTRUCTS TO SLIDE THE CARTRIDGE FULLY FORWARD INTO THE HANDPIECE SLOT UNTIL IT IS SECURED FIRMLY INTO POSITION. THE PLUNGER SHOULD MAKE INITIAL CONTACT WITH THE CARTRIDGE AT THE RAMP. IN THE EVENT THE PLUNGER DOES NOT CONTACT THE CARTRIDGE AT THE RAMP, DO NOT USE THE HANDPIECE AND CONTACT COMPANY. VERIFY THAT THE PLUNGER TIP IS PROPERLY ENGAGING THE LENS OPTIC AND THAT THE LENS MOVES FORWARD AT THE SAME RATE AS THE PLUNGER WHILE SLOWLY ADVANCING THE PLUNGER FORWARD TO AVOID DAMAGING THE LENS. THE COMPANY CARTRIDGE IFU INSTRUCTS: THE COMPANY CARTRIDGES ARE QUALIFIED FOR USE WITH COMPATIBLE COMPANY HANDPIECES FOR THE SURGICAL IMPLANTATION OF COMPANY QUALIFIED FOLDABLE IOLS. COMPANY FOLDABLE IOLS ARE QUALIFIED FOR USE WITH AN COMPANY QUALIFIED DELIVERY SYSTEM (HANDPIECE AND CARTRIDGE) AND OPHTHALMIC VISCOSURGICAL DEVICE (OVD) COMBINATION. THE USE OF AN UNQUALIFIED COMBINATION MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE IOL AND POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS DURING THE IMPLANTATION PROCESS. THE DAMAGE OBSERVED TO THE TIP OF THE USED CARTRIDGE MAY OCCUR IF THE LENS IS NOT POSITIONED CORRECTLY/FOLDED CORRECTLY FOR ADVANCEMENT; IF THERE IS A LACK OF VISCOELASTIC BETWEEN THE LENS AND THE CARTRIDGE LUMEN; AND/OR IF THE HANDPIECE PLUNGER IS NOT POSITIONED CORRECTLY AT THE TRAILING OPTIC EDGE. THIS CAN ALLOW THE LENS TO FOLD AROUND THE PLUNGER TIP MAKING IT TOO LARGE TO CORRECTLY ADVANCE THROUGH THE NARROW TIP OF THE CARTRIDGE CAUSING DAMAGE. TOP COAT DYE STAIN TESTING WAS CONDUCTED WITH ACCEPTABLE RESULTS. THERE ARE TWO OTHER COMPLAINTS IN THE LOT FROM THE SAME FACILITY. THE MANUFACTURER INTERNAL REFERENCE NUMBER IS: (B)(4).

A NON-HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL REPORTED THAT, FOLLOWING INTRAOCULAR LENS IMPLANT PROCEDURE, A LENS WAS RETURNED WHICH WAS FAULTY. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS REQUESTED. THE DEVICE AND THE LENS WERE RETURNED IN THE OPENED BLISTER TRAY INSIDE THE OPENED DEVICE. THE LENS STOP AND THE PLUNGER LOCK WERE REMOVED. THE PLUNGER WAS ORIENTED CORRECTLY. VISCOELASTIC WAS OBSERVED IN THE DEVICE. THE PLUNGER WAS ALMOST COMPLETELY DEPLOYED. THE PLUNGER HAS ADVANCED MOST OF THE LENS BEYOND THE DEVICE NOZZLE TIP. THE OPTIC AND LEADING HAPTIC WERE OUTSIDE THE DEVICE TIP. THE TRAILING HAPTIC WAS EXTENDED ALONG THE POSTERIOR OF THE DEVICE AND WAS CAUGHT BY THE PLUNGER. THE NOZZLE WAS CRACKED PRIOR TO THE FILL LINE. THE CRACK TRAVELLED THROUGH THE THICK NOZZLE CONE WALL AND EXTENDED INTO SPLIT TIP DAMAGE ALONG THE POSTERIOR OF THE TIP. THE DEVICE WAS CLEANED FOR FURTHER EVALUATION. TOP COAT DYE STAIN TESTING WAS CONDUCTED WITH ACCEPTABLE RESULTS. PRODUCT HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED AND DOCUMENTATION INDICATED THE PRODUCT MET RELEASE CRITERIA. VISCOELASTIC INFORMATION WAS NOT PROVIDED. IT IS UNKNOWN IF A QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC WAS USED. THE ROOT CAUSE CANNOT BE DETERMINED FOR THE REPORTED COMPLAINT. THE PLUNGER WAS POSITIONED ON TOP OF THE TRAILING HAPTIC IN THE DAMAGED TIP. THE REMAINDER OF THE LENS WAS BEYOND THE DEVICE TIP. THE NOZZLE AND TIP WERE SPLIT ALONG THE POSTERIOR. THE DAMAGE BEGAN IN THE THICK NOZZLE CONE WALL ON THE POSTERIOR AND TRAVELLED TO THE THINNER TIP AREA. THE TWO DISTINCT AREAS OF DAMAGE WOULD INDICATE A PROGRESSIVE CHANGE THAT OCCURRED AS THE LENS WAS ADVANCED AND NOT AN IMMEDIATE ¿BURST¿ EVENT, UNLESS THE LENS WAS ADVANCED AT A VERY FAST RATE. THIS TYPE OF DAMAGE TYPICALLY OCCURS IF THE LENS IS NOT POSITIONED CORRECTLY FOR ADVANCEMENT; IF THERE IS A LACK OF VISCOELASTIC BETWEEN THE LENS AND THE CARTRIDGE LUMEN; IF THE LENS IS ADVANCED TOO RAPIDLY OR IF THE HANDPIECE PLUNGER IS NOT POSITIONED CORRECTLY AT THE TRAILING OPTIC EDGE. IF THE HANDPIECE PLUNGER IS NOT POSITIONED AT THE TRAILING OPTIC EDGE IT CAN ALLOW THE LENS TO FOLD AROUND THE PLUNGER TIP MAKING IT TOO LARGE TO CORRECTLY ADVANCE THROUGH THE NARROW TIP OF THE CARTRIDGE, WHICH COULD CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE TIP OR THE LENS. IF THE PLUNGER IS NOT FULLY ADVANCED THE TRAILING HAPTIC MAY NOT RELEASE PROPERLY FROM THE DEVICE. THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU) INSTRUCTS: DURING DEVICE PREPARATION AND IMPLANTATION OF THE COMPANY IOL WITH THE COMPANY PRELOADED DELIVERY SYSTEM, A COMPANY QUALIFIED OPHTHALMIC VISCOELASTIC DEVICE (OVD) SHOULD BE USED. THE USE OF AN UNQUALIFIED OVD MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE LENS AND POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS DURING THE DEVICE PREPARATION AND IMPLANTATION STEPS.

HE SAID THE CLOSE-UP VISION IS LIKE HE IS FUNCTIONALLY BLIND, INTERMEDIATE IS MEDIOCRE AT BEST, AND DISTANCE LACKS SHARPNESS. BEING A GRAPHIC DESIGNER AND A MUSICIAN, THE PATIENT IS EXPOSED TO SEVERAL LIGHT SOURCES AND EXPERIENCES HALOS, GLARE, AND STARBURSTS WHEN LOOKING AT MONITORS AND CELL PHONES. HE DESCRIBES HIS VISION AS LOOKING THROUGH DIRTY CONTACTS, HE MUST COVER HIS IMPLANTED EYE WITH HIS HAND WHEN LOOKING AT HIS PHONE TO CLEARLY SEE IT. PEOPLE APPEAR TO HAVE AN AURA (HALO-GLARE EFFECT) WHEN LOOKING AT THE SCREEN. HIS VISION IS AWFUL 13-14 INCHES AWAY. AFTER (B)(6) 2022 DOCTOR'S VISIT, PATIENT'S INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE (IOP) WAS 26 MM HG; HIS DOCTOR¿S IOP TARGET FOR HIM IS 21 MM HG. HIS VISUAL ACUITY WAS 20/25 WITH BOTH EYES OPEN. PATIENT HAS ALWAYS HAD MYOPIA AND WORN GLASSES, BUT NO HISTORY OF GLAUCOMA OR LASIK PROCEDURES. THROUGH FURTHER FOLLOW-UP, ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS RECEIVED BY THE PATIENT STATING HIS VISION IS WORSE; IT IS FUZZY, GRAINY WAXY, NO CLOSE-UP VISION, LIKE LOW DIGITAL RESOLUTION, NO VIBRANCY, LIFELESS, LIKE A SIMULATION, COLORS DO NOT POP; AS THOUGH HE IS LOOKING THROUGH AN OLD CAMERA WITH POOR RESOLUTION. HE ALSO NOTED HIS EYE IS SHAKING BUT DOESN'T KNOW IF IT IS HIS CILIARY MUSCLES. HE CAN READ WITH HIS GLASSES OFF AND HAS NOTICED IF HE LOOKS IN THE MIRROR, HE CAN SEE HIS PUPIL OPENING AND CLOSING QUICKLY. HE DROVE FOR THE FIRST TIME AT NIGHT; ALL THE STREETS AND OTHER LIGHTS, INCLUDING HEADLIGHTS, HAD HALOS BUT MOSTLY STARBURSTS 25-35 FEET AWAY. IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR HIM, AND HE HAD TO PULL OVER UNTIL HE SETTLED DOWN AND COULD DRIVE WITH ONLY HIS NON-IMPLANTED EYE OPENED. IN ADDITION, HE SAID HE COULD SEE WELL ENOUGH TO DRIVE DURING THE DAY BUT THAT HIS VISON WAS NOT GREAT. BUT WHEN HE ATTEMPTED TO DRIVE AT NIGHT, HE HAD TO PULL OVER AND SHAKE OFF DIZZINESS. HE SAID HE EXPERIENCED STARBURSTS AND HALOS THAT BLENDED INTO EACH OTHER AND THAT THE LIGHT FROM HEADLIGHTS BLENDED INTO ONE ANOTHER.

THE ARTICLE STATES " ON THE FIRST DAY AFTER SURGERY, THE PATIENT COMPLAINED OF HEADACHE, NAUSEA, AND LOW VISION IN THE LEFT EYE. THE INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE (IOP) IN THE LE WAS 32 MMHG. A SLIT LAMP EXAMINATION REVEALED SHALLOW ANTERIOR CHAMBER AND A PARTIAL THICKNESS IRIDOTOMY WHICH DID NOT INCLUDE THE PIGMENTARY EPITHELIUM. THIS PEAK OF IOP WAS SUCCESSFULLY TREATED, AS DESCRIBED LATER. THE RIGHT EYE HAD A WIDE PHARMACOLOGIC MYDRIASIS AND IOP OF 8 MMHG THE FIRST DAY, BUT THE NEXT DAY THE IOP WAS 30 MMHG. SLIT LAMP EXAMINATION OF THE RE THE SECOND DAY WAS COMPARABLE TO THAT OF THE LE THE PREVIOUS DAY. SLIT LAMP EXAMINATION REVEALED THAT THE PERIPHERAL IRIDOTOMY WAS NOT APPROPRIATELY THICK; EACH IRIDOTOMY WAS COMPLETED WITH A NEODYMIUM:YAG (ND:YAG) LASER UNDER HIGH POWER. YAG LASER TREATMENT WAS APPLIED OVER THE PIGMENTARY EPITHELIUM. A SINGLE BURST OF 3.0 MJ WAS ENOUGH TO PERFORATE THE PIGMENTARY EPITHELIUM. A FLOW OF AQUEOUS FROM THE POSTERIOR TO ANTERIOR CHAMBER OCCURRED INSTANTLY UPON PENETRATION OF THE IRIS PIGMENT EPITHELIUM, WITH IMMEDIATE DEEPENING OF THE PERIPHERAL ANTERIOR CHAMBER AND NORMALIZATION OF THE ICL VAULT. ORAL ACETAZOLAMIDE AND BRIMONIDINE TARTRATE/TIMOLOL MALEATE DROPS 2 TIMES A DAY WERE PRESCRIBED. THREE MONTHS AFTER SURGERY, THE PATIENT'S VISUAL ACUITY WAS 20/20 IN BOTH EYES.

PRODUCT HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED AND THE DOCUMENTATION INDICATED THE PRODUCT MET RELEASE CRITERIA. VISCOELASTIC WAS NOT PROVIDED. IT IS UNKNOWN IF A QUALIFIED PRODUCT WAS USED. THERE ARE TWO OTHER COMPLAINTS IN THIS LOT. THE PRODUCT INVESTIGATION COULD NOT IDENTIFY A ROOT CAUSE. THE INSTRUCTION FOR USE (IFU) INSTRUCTS: DURING DEVICE PREPARATION AND IMPLANTATION OF THE COMPANY IOL WITH THE COMPANY PRELOADED DELIVERY SYSTEM, AN COMPANY QUALIFIED OPHTHALMIC VISCOELASTIC DEVICE (OVD) SHOULD BE USED. THE USE OF AN UNQUALIFIED OVD MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE LENS AND POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS DURING THE DEVICE PREPARATION AND IMPLANTATION STEPS. PLUNGER OVERRIDE MAY OCCUR: DUE TO RAPID ADVANCEMENT FASTER THAN THE DIRECTION FOR USE (DFU) RECOMMEND RATE. DUE TO THE USE OF A NON-QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC. MATERIAL PROPERTIES OF NON-QUALIFIED OVDS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO UNDERFILL, OVERFILL, MISFOLDING OF THE HAPTICS, OR OTHER INCONSISTENT FOLDING OUTCOMES. IF INADEQUATE VISCOELASTIC IS PLACED IN THE DEVICE THIS WILL CAUSE INADEQUATE COVERAGE OF THE LENS FOLD PATH WHICH MAY CAUSE THE LENS TO ADVANCE INCORRECTLY OR BECOME ¿STUCK¿ IN THE DEVICE ALLOWING THE PLUNGER TO OVERRIDE THE LENS. IF THE DEVICE IS OVERFILLED WITH OVD, THIS CAN PREVENT THE TRAILING HAPTIC FROM BEING PLACED PROPERLY OR MOVE THE LENS OUT OF POSITION RESULTING IN MISFOLDING. IF THE OPERATING ROOM TEMPERATURE IS TOO HIGH (> 23°C / 73° F) LENS FOLDING CONSISTENCY IS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED, THE LENS IS MORE ADHERENT AND THIS MAY INHIBIT LENS ADVANCEMENT. ANY OF THE ABOVE LISTED CAUSES ALONE, OR IN COMBINATION, MAY CREATE THE REPORTED EVENT. THE MANUFACTURER INTERNAL REFERENCE NUMBER IS: (B)(4).
A NON HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL REPORTED THAT DURING AN INTRAOCULAR LENS (IOL) IMPLANT PROCEDURE, THE SURGEON NOTED THE LENS HAD A SCRATCH AFTER IMPLANTING, SO HE CRACKED IT IN HALF, REMOVED IT, AND INSERTED A NEW LENS. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN REQUESTED. A SAMPLE DEVICE WAS NOT RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS. COMPLAINT HISTORY AND PRODUCT HISTORY RECORDS COULD NOT BE REVIEWED BECAUSE THE REPORTING FACILITY DID NOT PROVIDE A LOT NUMBER OR ANY IDENTIFICATION TRACEABLE TO THE MANUFACTURING DOCUMENTATION. ROOT CAUSE HAS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED. THE MANUFACTURER INTERNAL REFERENCE NUMBER IS: (B)(4).
